{"text": "Other workers in the sector are following the dispute particularly keenly as they feel they have been trampled on by their bosses' competitive race to the bottom. <<|needle|>>Concern has been expressed by some managements in the sector that they are cutting each other's throats by competing on price and driving down wages and standards.\n\nUnite has called on responsible employers to talk about a national agreement that would take wages out of competition by setting 'rates for the job', and could serve as a guarantee of standards in the sector.\n\nUnite LE1111 branch secretary and Socialist Party member Suzanne Muna commented: \"Unite has such an agreement with employers in Scotland; if they care about services for vulnerable people why not talk to Unite in England and Wales?\"\n\nSuzanne has initiated the call for 'Sector Standards' as a housing and social care 'JIB' so there would be the development of national terms and conditions in the sector.\n\nThe London based Unite housing branch LE1111, in which Socialist Party members play a leading role, has had a number of disputes (in Equinox, One Housing Group, Peabody and HCA) recently in which workers have fought back against management attacks on pay and conditions. <<|needle|>>This reflects a conscious attempt to support union reps in the branch in organising and mobilising.\n\nWorkers in the sector feel increasingly desperate as their living standards are squeezed, management becomes increasingly hard line and they see services for some of the worst hit victims of the crisis undermined. <<|needle|>>When convinced that their reps are determined and supported by their union, there is a mood to fight to the end.\n\nThis is a struggle that can be won. <<|needle|>>Last year, Unite members at the St Mungo's Hitchin project were successful with sustained industrial action.This mood is also reflected in the recent victorious strikes in Greenwich libraries (members of another Unite branch where Socialist Party members play a leading role) and at the Ritzy cinema, as well as in the ongoing firefighters' dispute. <<|needle|>>They demonstrate the potential for coordinated action if a national lead was given.\n\nIn the HCA dispute, where Suzanne Muna is the senior Unite steward, strike action was coordinated with the PCS over two years, linking the campaigns against cuts and for fair pay with the austerity measures and coordinated action as the key industrial strategy that could defeat cuts.\n\nThe issues at stake in the St Mungo's dispute will resonate with workers across the country. <<|needle|>>It is important that the issues are raised with workers and that support is mobilised for the strikers. <<|needle|>>Strikers should be invited to speak at meetings, solidarity greetings sent and collections taken.\n\nTo help the union's solidarity appeal, the National Shop Stewards Network is asking its supporters to organise collections, donations and speakers at meetings. <<|needle|>>The NSSN will work in conjunction with a new support group set up by Unite.\n\nThis version of this article was first posted on the Socialist Party website on 4 November 2014 and may vary slightly from the version subsequently printed in The Socialist.Protection of the TheotokosWe have a busy liturgical day. <<|needle|>>The feast of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux (the Little Flower) and the Slavic Byzantine Church honors Mary under the title the “Protection of the Theotokos.” AND we need her protection!!!\n\nThis medieval prose (i.e.,  a devotional poem for use in the liturgy) uses the sentiment of the “Ave Maria.”\n\nHail Mary, full of grace,\nthe Lord is with you, serene Virgin.\nFor lowly and great,\nlion and lamb,\nour savior Christ:\nyou have been his temple,\nwhile still a virgin.\n\nFor the flower and rose,\nthe bread and the shepherd:\nyou queen of virgins,\na rose without a thorn,\nyou became their mother.\n\nYou are the royal seat of justice,\nyou are the mother of mercy,\nfrom out of the depths of dregs and misery\nhast seen Theophilus to grace.\n\nThe heavenly court praises you,\nyou the king’s mother and daughter;\nO sweetest Mary,\nthrough you the accused is forgiven.\n\nOur Lady of SorrowsScripture reveals that Mary, the Mother of Jesus, stood by the cross as her son died. <<|needle|>>This was foretold by Simeon in the Temple when Jesus was presented there. <<|needle|>>Hence, this feast acknowledges Mary as a martyr because of the intense pain of the sword piercing her heart. <<|needle|>>As you would expect, how could a mother not be with her son as he died? Her humanity was closely united to that of his.\n\nGrasping the seriousness of this event gave way to the incredible composition of the sequence of Stabat Mater. <<|needle|>>Most parishes don’t sing this poetic text any longer but it used to be sung on this feast day and on Good Friday. <<|needle|>>Sometimes you’d hear it at the Stations of the Cross.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the rosary devotion of Seven Sorrows of Mary you will want to visit this site. <<|needle|>>This devotion has its roots in the 12th century and was made extraordinarily popular in the 13th. <<|needle|>>People like Saints Anselm and Bernard advocated this form of the rosary; the Benedictines, Cistercians and then the Servite friars took up the devotion to the Seven Sorrows of Mary. <<|needle|>>The feast of Our Lady of Sorrows was placed on the Roman Calendar by Pope Benedict XIII in 1727 and observed on the Friday prior to Palm Sunday; at the revision of the liturgical calendar the feast moved to this date. <<|needle|>>But the feast does have a variety of observances in other parts of the Church.\n\nThis is yet another truly Benedictine feast as it draws us to the foot of the cross. <<|needle|>>Given yesterday’s feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, today gives us the perspective of the mother. <<|needle|>>Mary’s sorrows have become our own sorrows; this is a reasonable feast that recognizes as concrete the place of sorrow in our experience. <<|needle|>>But sorrow is not the final chapter in this life: sorrow gives way to peace and joy. <<|needle|>>I am thinking of the mothers who have lost a child to all sorts of circumstances (sudden death, miscarriage, addictions, murder, war, abortion). <<|needle|>>Saint Benedict and his sons and daughters help to point the way to salvation in Christ through the cross.\n\nThe great Cistercian abbot Saint Bernard directs our thoughts and prayer in the following homily.\n\nThe martyrdom of the Virgin is set forth both in the prophecy of Simeon and in the actual story of our Lord’s passion. <<|needle|>>The holy old man said of the infant Jesus: He has been established as a sign which will be contradicted. <<|needle|>>He went on to say to Mary: And your own heart will be pierced by a sword.\n\nTruly, O blessed Mother, a sword has pierced your heart. <<|needle|>>For only by passing through your heart could the sword enter the flesh of your Son. <<|needle|>>Indeed, after your Jesus – who belongs to everyone, but is especially yours – gave up his life, the cruel spear, which was not withheld from his lifeless body, tore open his side. <<|needle|>>Clearly it did not touch his soul and could not harm him, but it did pierce your heart. <<|needle|>>For surely his soul was no longer there, but yours could not be torn away. <<|needle|>>Thus the violence of sorrow has cut through your heart, and we rightly call you more than martyr, since the effect of compassion in you has gone beyond the endurance of physical suffering.\n\nOr were those words, Woman, behold your Son, not more than a word to you, truly piercing your heart, cutting through to the division between soul and spirit? What an exchange! John is given to you in place of Jesus, the servant in place of the Lord, the disciple in place of the master; the son of Zebedee replaces the Son of God, a mere man replaces God himself. <<|needle|>>How could these words not pierce your most loving heart, when the mere remembrance of them breaks ours, hearts of iron and stone though they are!\n\nDo not be surprised, brothers, that Mary is said to be a martyr in spirit. <<|needle|>>Let him be surprised who does not remember the words of Paul, that one of the greatest crimes of the Gentiles was that they were without love. <<|needle|>>That was far from the heart of Mary; let it be far from her servants.\n\nPerhaps someone will say: “Had she not known before that he would not die?” Undoubtedly. <<|needle|>>“Did she not expect him to rise again at once?” Surely. <<|needle|>>“And still she grieved over her crucified Son?” Intensely. <<|needle|>>Who are you and what is the source of your wisdom that you are more surprised at the compassion of Mary than at the passion of Mary’s Son? For if he could die in body, could she not die with him in spirit? He died in body through a love greater than anyone had known. <<|needle|>>She died in spirit through a love unlike any other since his.\n\nNativity of Mary, the Mother of GodPrayer in honor of Our Lady’s Nativity by Saint Anselm\n\nWhen thou wast born, O most holy Virgin, then was the world made light.\n\nHave mercy therefore upon me a sinner, and give me aid, O Lady, so that just as thy nativity, glorious from the seed of Abraham, sprung from the tribe of Juda, illustrious from the stock of David, didst announce joy to the entire world, so may it fill me with true joy and cleanse me from every sin.\n\nPray for me, O Virgin most prudent, that the gladsome joys of thy most helpful nativity may put a cloak over all my sins.\n\nO holy Mother of God, flowering as the lily, pray to thy sweet Son for me, a wretched sinner. <<|needle|>>Amen.Today we celebrate the Feast of the Queenship of Mary, established by Pope Pius XII in 1954:\n\nWhoever, therefore, reverences the Queen of heaven and earth – and let no one consider himself exempt from this tribute of a grateful and loving soul – let him invoke the most effective of Queens, the Mediatrix of peace; let him respect and preserve peace, which is not wickedness unpunished nor freedom without restraint, but a well-ordered harmony under the rule of the will of God; to its safeguarding and growth the gentle urgings and commands of the Virgin Mary impel us.\n\nOn this Feast of the Queenship of Mary, let us for the Church and society:\n\nHoly Mary, Queen of heaven, Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ and of his Church, who forsakes no one and despises no one, look upon me with an eye of pity, and entreat for me of your beloved Son the forgiveness of all my sins; that, as I now celebrate with affection your holy and immaculate conception, so hereafter, I may receive the prize of eternal blessedness, by the grace of him whom you, in virginity, brought forth, Jesus Christ our Lord: who, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, lives and reigns, in perfect Trinity, God for ever and ever. <<|needle|>>Amen.\n\n(A prayer from the book, Maiden and Mother)<image>Inspired from on high by God’s Spirit,\nthe apostles convened from all over the world,\nin honor of you, O Mother of light!\n\nAnd all heaven’s powers stood by the Master,\nfilled with awe and love,\nas they prepared to welcome you,\nin whom the Word of God had dwelt.\n\nWith joyful voices they sang forth their hymns of praise:\nToday, all creation rejoices,\nfor the Queen of all,\nthe very handmaid of the Lord, is nigh!\n\nOpen wide, all your portals on high:\nMake way for the Mother of light to enter in,\nfor through her all the world received salvation,\nfrom this Maid who exceeds all praise,\nfor her greatness is beyond all understanding.\n\nSo the, O fairest Lady,\nwe, too, celebrate your holy Dormition.\nNow that you dwell in everlasting glory with your divine Son,\nwe give you thanks on this glorious day and we bless you,\nfor you never cease praying for us!\n\nThe above text from Vespers sung by Byzantine Church which celebrates a vigil of the Dormition, as they call the feast. <<|needle|>>They use the term for the vigil as the “foretaste” of the Dormition of the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary. <<|needle|>>Hymn texts are very great communicators of what the Church believes to be beautiful, good and true. <<|needle|>>Like music, sacred art has an interesting way to move a believer to know a truth. <<|needle|>>In the image I placed with the text was painted by the Dominican Fra Angelico (Blessed John of Fiesole). <<|needle|>>You’ll notice the dormition (the falling asleep) of Mary and her Assumption, an act seemingly happening at the same moment. <<|needle|>>From a dogmatic point of view, the Catholic Church never definitively taught whether Mary experienced death, or not. <<|needle|>>Pope Pius XII left it an open question. <<|needle|>>Perhaps it is a both/and point.\n\nToday is a day to Bless Herbs. <<|needle|>>This is the blessing used by the Byzantines. <<|needle|>>More info: the Blessing of Herbs AND another Blessing.They love it. <<|needle|>>We want it. <<|needle|>>Three red-hot

a narrative for every little piece. <<|needle|>>It’s a bizarre and beautiful film; by the end, my jaw hurt from smiling.”\n—DANIEL HANNA\nOwner of Eyesore Cinema“I listen to classical music eight hours a day, and I would recommend this choral piece by the baroque composer Giovanni Battista Pergolesi to anyone. <<|needle|>>His Stabat Mater, a sacred hymn dedicated to the Virgin Mary, is one of his best-known and most intimate works. <<|needle|>>Italian contralto Marianna Pizzolato and Russian soprano Anna Netrebko sing together for the first time on this album, and their voices really blend nicely. <<|needle|>>Netrebko is a modern-day Maria Callas: gorgeous, a great actor and an incredible voice.”\n—VICTOR GHALOOSIAN\nCo-owner of L’Atelier Grigorian\n\nStabat Mater: A Tribute to

of railroads to build bridges across the river.\nWarren attended Knox College, where one of the Lincoln – Douglas debates took place, and the University of Illinois. <<|needle|>>His graduate training was at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and what is now Alliant University in Fresno, California.\nHe was first licensed as a psychologist in 1983. <<|needle|>>He has worked for agencies and in private practice. <<|needle|>>He has worked with people of all ages as a therapist and as an administrator. <<|needle|>>Warren is currently licensed in three states and has two national credentials.\nWarren Bull is the award-winning author of more than thirty short stories as well as memoirs, essays and a novel, Abraham Lincoln for the Defense, published by PublishAmerica, 2003 and Smashwords, 2010. <<|needle|>> His collection of short stories, Murder Manhattan Style, was published by Ninth Month Publishing, Co., in 2010. <<|needle|>> In addition, he has published in the anthologies Strange Mysteries, 3, 2, and 1 Whortleberry Press; Medium of Murder, Red Coyote Press, 2008; Fish Tales: The Guppy Anthology Wildside Press, 2011; Great Mystery and Suspense Magazine;

“literary” short stories, essays, memoirs and mystery novels. <<|needle|>>My latest publication is a collection of mystery short stories set in Manhattan, Kansas or Manhattan, New York.\nWhy did you choose this genre?\nSince 2003 I have had one novel published and between thirty and forty short stories published. <<|needle|>>As my wife is fond of saying, “Do the math.”  I have completed a Young Adult novel, and a second novel about Abraham Lincoln, which have generated enough interest among agents that I have been asked to send the entire manuscript a couple of times. <<|needle|>> Each time I got a polite “No thanks” in response. <<|needle|>>From a publisher’s point of view, the investment in a novel is much greater than in one short story in a magazine or anthology. <<|needle|>>Part of the cost of publishing a novel is the cost of not publishing novels that were not selected. <<|needle|>> The chances of getting a short story published are much greater than chances of getting a novel published. <<|needle|>> If I had stuck to only writing novels, I would have only one publication. <<|needle|>>In addition, I really like short stories. <<|needle|>>Moreover, I really like getting published.\n\nWhat are some of your books, stories that have been published?\nAbraham Lincoln for the Defense was my first novel published. <<|needle|>> It was based on an actual murder child trial that so intrigued Lincoln that he was still writing about it five years later. <<|needle|>>Resolution of the case solved one mystery, but it created a greater question that remains unanswered to this day. <<|needle|>>The novel introduces the reader to Lincoln while he is a young attorney developing into the man who will become the great emancipator. <<|needle|>> Lincoln’s writings about the case were so essential to the novel that I regard him as my co-author. <<|needle|>>The print version is out or print, but it is available at http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/13700Murder Manhattan Style, ISBN 13:987-0-9822271-3-8 is a collection of fifteen short stories recommended by Nancy Pickard, New York Times Bestselling author who said, “Warren Bull is a short story master, and this collection shows him at his best with quick stories told in crisp, clear prose. <<|needle|>>There’s variety, drama, history, humor, pathos, compassion and even Shakespeare here, along with surprising and satisfying endings to every story.” Earl Staggs, Derringer Award winning author said, “Murder Manhattan Style by master mystery writer Warren Bull is a collage of well-written stories as different as their settings, ranging form the Manhattan in Kansas to the town of the same name in New York. <<|needle|>>Wherever and whenever these well-drawn characters play out their stories, their more to savor than what they do and say. <<|needle|>> Underlying each engaging tale is a glimpse of what is going on in their minds. <<|needle|>>It takes a practicing psychologist to relate that element so sharply. <<|needle|>> Highly recommended. <<|needle|>>Available at http://www.ninthmonthpublishing.com/books.html\nSniplits short stories by Warren Bull are available at   http://www.sniplits.com/storiesforauthor.jsp?a=197\nHow do you come up with the names of places and characters in your books?Actually, it was not until I looked over a number of published stories that I realized I had used the same locations and some of the same characters for several stories. <<|needle|>> Manhattan, Kansas came from a short story contest at the Great Manhattan Mystery Conclave set in Manhattan. <<|needle|>>A requirement for the contest was to use the local setting. <<|needle|>>I became emotionally involved with a fictional family living in “Bleeding Kansas” before the Civil War. <<|needle|>> The story I wrote was called \"Beecher’s Bibles.”<image>As for Manhattan, New York, one year the conclave celebrated a locally born author, Damon Runyon. <<|needle|>> That set off a fun series of story ideas.My friend and mentor, Bob Iles, who is now deceased, wrote a series of stories about a detective in post-World War II Manhattan. <<|needle|>> With his permission, I borrowed the world he created and wrote a story that began in his detective’s office. <<|needle|>> It was great fun as well as a challenge to write, “The Wrong Man.”  As a story, it got more rejections and more editorial praise along with the rejections than anything else I have ever written. <<|needle|>> It was first available online. <<|needle|>>Then it was accepted as an audio story on Sniplits. <<|needle|>>Now it is also in my short story collection. <<|needle|>> It is my favorite story to read at signings and always gets a strong positive audience reaction.\nWhat is your favorite thing about your book?\nI like the opportunity to roam over time and space. <<|needle|>> It is fun to create a tight but complete story arc in so many different setting and with so many different characters. <<|needle|>>Of course, sometimes I have the attention span of a puppy in a yard full of squirrels.\nHow is writing in the genre you write, different than other genre?\nWith a novel, every word counts and that is even more crucial with a short story. <<|needle|>> I try to indicate character in as few words as possible by action and description. <<|needle|>> For example in a story I’m working on now, I describe a character who talks about how terrible it is that her boss when murdered and then checks in the mirror to see that her mascara is still intact.\nWhy and when did you begin writing?\nI cannot remember not writing since I learned how to read. <<|needle|>> My mother kept the spiral bound notebooks that I used to write stories in while I was in elementary school. <<|needle|>>When I was in my freshman year at college, I came home on break and was mortified to discover that she had shared everything I wrote to her with the neighbors.\nWhat is your writing schedule?\nI write almost every day, pretty much any time of day when I have a moment free. <<|needle|>>Sometimes at night my writing brain (or muse) will wake me up or not let me sleep until I write some more. <<|needle|>>Nighttime is when the muse is most likely to want me to correct mistakes, improve the rough patches, or add necessary information. <<|needle|>> Since I know the characters, I write about, I sometimes forget that I need to explain things to my readers.\nWhat projects are you working on now, or plan for the future?\nI am still shopping my novels and still writing short stories. <<|needle|>> I plan to continue writing both. <<|needle|>>I took about none years to get my first novel published and I continue to write novel. <<|needle|>> That clearly proves I do not have enough sense to know when to stop.\nWhat kind of advice or tips to you have for someone who wants to write (especially mystery)?\nTake the time to learn the craft. <<|needle|>> Look for a good critique group or writing partner. <<|needle|>>Writing is a solitary activity and I have never met a successful writer who did not have at least one knowledgeable reader. <<|needle|>> And, persist. <<|needle|>>Join Sisters in Crime and Mystery Writers of America. <<|needle|>> And, persist some more.\nAre there any other comments, advice or tips that you would give to beginning writers?\nAs a recovering editor and writing contest judge, I strongly recommend you read and follow the directions for submissions, query letters, contests etc. <<|needle|>> It will not guarantee publication but it will get you read. <<|needle|>> That gives you a gigantic advantage over people who do not read and follow directions and therefore will never be read.\nWhat do you do when you are not writing?\nI eat, sleep, do the laundry or wash dishes. <<|needle|>> I worked as a clinical psychologist for more than twenty-five years. <<|needle|>> After my second bone marrow transplant for multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer), I retired.\nWhat “Made It” moments have you experienced in life?\nWinning awards is a sign of success. <<|needle|>>“Beecher’s Bibles” won an award. <<|needle|>> “A Lady of Quality,” available on Sniplits, won an award for the best short story of the year in 2006 from the Missouri Writers’ Guild. <<|needle|>> It was featured on Sniplits for Black History Month. <<|needle|>>Another story was voted best in the anthology it was published in by readers. <<|needle|>> Getting published, and having more than one story accepted by a single publisher definitely makes my day. <<|needle|>> I was pleased and flattered to get positive reviews from authors I respect. <<|needle|>> Being recognized by readers and getting compliments from them is a wonderful feeling. <<|needle|>> I am also well aware that one publication is no guarantee there will ever be another one. <<|needle|>> Writing is like dancing on a knife’s edge.\nLearn more about Warren Bull and read

<<|needle|>>I learned a lot about Warren the person as well as Warren the writer.\n\nI finally finished the short story collection and especially loved the Manhattan KS pioneer series. <<|needle|>>Very nice collection! Thanks for this interview!About the Talk\nDrawing on ethnographic fieldwork with energy financiers in Houston, Texas, Sean Field explores how experts use a lexicon of models and metrics to conceptualize and construct allegories about future hydrocarbon projects and companies. <<|needle|>>Dr. <<|needle|>>Field shows that allegorical narratives built with this lexicon advance a kind of energy ethics – distinguishing what is good and advocating for particular energy futures. <<|needle|>>As the energy industry pivots toward renewables, Dr. <<|needle|>>Field argues that these metrics, models and allegories are coming to bear on new forms of extraction. <<|needle|>>This talk is based on a recent paper, Carbon Capital: The Lexicon and Allegories of US Hydrocarbon Finance.About the Presenter\nSean Field is a Research Fellow at the Centre for Energy Ethics and in the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of St Andrews. <<|needle|>>Since late-2018, his research has focused on how financial professionals ethically and financially value energy. <<|needle|>>His ethnographic work explores the calculation of risk, the performance of financial expertise, the valuation of energy resources, and the integration of ESG into investment practices.\n\nA key implication of his research is that the world of finance is central to the materialization of our collective energy and anthropogenic landscapes. <<|needle|>>Dr. <<|needle|>>Field's project is part of the larger Energy Ethics research project led by Dr. <<|needle|>>Mette High and funded by the European Research Council.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2013, the Indonesian Government instituted a national cooking fuel conversion program, transitioning households away from biomass and kerosene and towards liquid petroleum gas (LPG) through adjustments to kerosene and LPG subsidies. <<|needle|>>In this talk, Penn State's Emily Pakhtigian will discuss the household and individual impacts of this large-scale cooking transition. <<|needle|>>In particular, she will focus on the impacts of early-life policy-induced improved indoor air quality on children's cognitive development and health. <<|needle|>>As countries around the world look to improve climate and health through clean energy transitions, understanding the social impacts of such policies is essential for developing efficient, equitable, and sustainable policies.About the Talk\nFor over a billion households today, electricity is still unavailable, unreliable, or unaffordable. <<|needle|>>Historically, the use of stand-alone decentralized renewable energy (DRE) for rural electrification primarily focused on powering lights and mobile chargers. <<|needle|>>In the past decade, the electrification agenda has shifted to a demand-centric approach, focusing on understanding how rural livelihoods, healthcare, and education can be powered by DRE, enabled by a supporting ecosystem. <<|needle|>>In this talk, Vivek Shastry will present findings from an in-depth field study of rural entrepreneurs in southern India who are using solar powered appliances for a range of rural livelihoods and businesses. <<|needle|>>Specifically, he explores the market and non-market factors that influence entrepreneurs' access to these solutions, and the mechanisms through which they contribute to building their resilience to future livelihood and climate shocks.About the Presenter\nVivek Shastry is passionate about facilitating inclusive development through sustainable energy solutions. <<|needle|>>As a doctoral candidate in Public Policy at the University of Texas at Austin, his current work explores the intersection of energy access, primary health care, rural livelihoods, and gender. <<|needle|>>Prior to pursuing his doctorate, he earned master's degrees in Sustainable Design, and Community and Regional Planning from the University of Texas at Austin and worked with the policy and planning group at SELCO Foundation. <<|needle|>>He has traveled extensively in rural India and worked on decentralized renewable energy projects from implementation, research, and policy perspectives.\n\nAbout the Talk\nUnderstanding the economic impacts of climate change is essential to designing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, but the magnitudes and mechanisms of these impacts are poorly constrained, as are the contributions of individual actors to these impacts. <<|needle|>>In this talk, Callahan will discuss his research understanding and quantifying the economic growth impacts of extreme climate events, isolating the roles of individual emitters in contributing to historical climate damages using simple climate model simulations, and illustrating coupled feedbacks between climate adaptation and global warming. <<|needle|>>Collectively, this work aims to build a fuller understanding of the coupled climate-economy system in a warming world.About the Presenter\nChris Callahan is a PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Dartmouth College in the EEES program, working with Dr. <<|needle|>>Justin Mankin and the Climate Modeling and Impacts Group. <<|needle|>>His research focuses on the economic and social consequences of climate change. <<|needle|>>He uses a wide range of tools, from simple and complex climate models to econometric regression techniques, to understand the relationship between extreme climate events and outcomes such as human health and economic growth. <<|needle|>>His work aims to inform policy discussions over climate mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage funding, as well as decisionmaking tools such as the social cost of carbon.\n\nNew Energy: Conversations with Early-Career Energy Researchers is an online series featuring graduate, post-doctoral, and other early-career researchers sharing their discoveries and perspectives on energy-related topics. <<|needle|>>From policy to analysis to emerging technology, this bi-weekly series will give anyone interested in energy the opportunity to learn from the rising stars in the field.\n\nAll events in this series take place via Zoom.<image>The lithium-ion battery is a key enabling technology for transport decarbonization. <<|needle|>>While substantial impact reduction can be achieved, their use has also sparked concern due to the use of critical materials such as cobalt, nickel, and lithium. <<|needle|>>Through the circularity principles of reduce, reuse, repurpose, and recycle, resource conservation and impact mitigation can be achieved. <<|needle|>>This presentation will discuss current research, industry development, and policy which supports lithium-ion battery material circularity.\n\nDunn is currently finishing her Doctorate in Energy Systems at the University of California, Davis. <<|needle|>>During her studies she was a co-facilitator for the California Lithium-ion Battery Recycling Advisory group and a private consultant for the International Energy Agency on topics related to energy technologies and battery systems. <<|needle|>>In addition, she published several academic journal articles about using industrial technology methods to forecast and evaluate the impact of battery recycling.\n\nPrior to pursuing her doctorate, she earned a master's degree from University College London in Economics and Policy of the Environment and Energy and worked in the energy and environmental consulting industries.In Kenya, between 2010 and 2015, the number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) connected to the grid increased by over 60%. <<|needle|>>Despite this substantial increase, little is known about the behavioral patterns or conditions that contribute to increased electricity consumption among these SMEs. <<|needle|>>In his talk, Bob Muhwezi, PhD student at the University of Amherst Massachusetts, will discuss a recent study that addresses the problem through a longitudinal analysis of monthly electricity bills for over 179,000 grid connected SMEs in Kenya. <<|needle|>>The study leverages multiple publicly available geospatial datasets to estimate how complementary infrastructural variables (such as access to roads, markets, financial services, and macro/micro-economic conditions) correlate with sustained electricity consumption growth by SMEs.\n\nBob Muhwezi is a third year PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. <<|needle|>>Prior to joining UMass, he graduated with a master's in electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from Carnegie Mellon University-Africa in Kigali, Rwanda. <<|needle|>>He then worked in the planning department of the Energy Development Corporation (EDCL) of Rwanda where he was responsible for modeling optimal expansion of the nation's generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. <<|needle|>>His current research centers on the application of data-driven methods to understand electricity demand in data-scarce countries. <<|needle|>>Specifically, he uses a combination of remotely sensed and ground-collected data to understand how infrastructural features influence electricity consumption growth in some sub-Saharan countries.\n\nView a recording of this talk.To support the delivery of an equitable and just transition, it is imperative to study models of ownership that can sustainably promote adoption. <<|needle|>>The aim of the study is to assess the benefits of co-operatively owned and operated storage systems. <<|needle|>>The underlying hypothesis is that there is a monetary and non-monetary value to residential storage. <<|needle|>>The hypothesis is built on the flexibility offered by storage as a demand response asset, which can be used by residents in price-based demand response programs and equally provides consumers with increased autonomy and reduced cost.\n\nVivian Ogechi Nwadiaru received her bachelor's in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and an MS in Energy Engineering. <<|needle|>>Before joining UMass Amherst as a Ph.D. <<|needle|>>student, she completed an International Climate Protection Research Fellowship funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation at the Technical University of Berlin and the University of Oxford, investigating Nigeria's energy transition and proliferation of fossil backup generators. <<|needle|>>Her research with ELEVATE explores equitable demand response strategies, such as pricing schemes for deploying solar and storage technologies to reduce cost and improve reliability in low-income communities.On February 24, 2022 the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, 40 km from the border with Russia, woke up on the frontline of the large-scale war. <<|needle|>>The rapid drop in population from 1.5 million to 800,000 and continuous damage inflicted to urban infrastructure led to visible and invisible transformations affecting local habits, the way the city looks, the way its services operate and more. <<|needle|>>In her talk, Viktoriia Grivina will reflect on some of the strategies that the local government, big and small businesses, transport and communal services, as well as the inhabitants remaining in Kharkiv, have adopted in order to minimize the consequences of the large- and small-scale destructions, energy crisis, and the persistent danger resulting from daily shelling and missile strikes targeting residential areas of the city.\n\nTaking the perspective of a local resident, Grivina will highlight the changes in daily routines of the city, survival strategies and methods of adaptation, from window protection to the rule of the two walls, amendments to everyday routines, shopping, commute and preparations for the winter season. <<|needle|>>Analyzing these changes might help us better understand how war (and other crises) reveal critical energy issues in the city, flaws in its infrastructure and the potential for energy efficiency improvements.\n\nResearcher, translator, writer, Viktoriia Grivina graduated from V.N. <<|needle|>>Karazin Kharkiv National University majoring in English and German Linguistics. <<|needle|>>In 2018-2020 she was awarded Erasmus Mundus Master's scholarship with Crossways in Cultural Narratives programme (Universities of Tubingen, St Andrews, and Bergamo). <<|needle|>>In 2020 Viktoriia presented her Master's dissertation (The Influence of Street Art on Community Development in Kharkiv, Ukraine). <<|needle|>>In September 2020, she joined the project \"(Un)Archiving (Post)Industry\" implemented by the Center for Urban History jointly with the University of St Andrews. <<|needle|>>In 2021 she started her PhD research at the University of St. <<|needle|>>Andrews, focusing on mythology, ecology and aesthetics in the city of Kharkiv

On TourNelly’s facing new legal trouble! A woman is suing him for an alleged s-xual assault after one of his shows in England.\n\nThe woman, who’s filed as Jane Doe, claims Nelly masturbated in front of her multiple times after the December 2017 Essex concert.\n\nDoe claims she rebuffed him several times but Nelly would not back off, and told her he wanted to ejaculate on her. <<|needle|>>She says she told him something to effect of … “You may have more quid in your bank than I do. <<|needle|>>But this doesn’t make you any more special. <<|needle|>>Pull your trousers back up and f*** off.”\n\nThe woman claims Nelly got aggressive and clenched his fist and when she asked if he was going to hit her, he allegedly said … “No I’m just frustrated.\n\nI’m not used to not getting my way, just do it.”\n\nShe claims he forced his p-nis into her mouth, and that’s when she jumped back and was able to flee the room.\n\nAs we first reported … Nelly and another woman, Monique Greene, reached a mutual settlement after he was accused of r-ping her on his tour bus in October 2017.Rave of the moment Naira Marley, has indicated he would be releasing an EP (Extended Play) soon. <<|needle|>>The singer...<image>Kenya Moore, a former Miss USA and Real Housewives of Atlanta alumni, welcomed her first child today and she...KRIS Jenner took a swipe at Kourtney Kardashian amid the oldest daughter’s feud with the rest of her famous family.\n\nIn a steamy Instagram post, Kourtney, 43, and Travis Barker, 46, could not keep their hands off each other.Kris Jenner appeared on the show with Kylie JennerCredit: The Late Late Show with James Corden\n\nDuring their public display of affection, the couple cuddled while inside their private jet.\n\nIn the steamy post, Kourtney appeared to be straddling her husband while her arms were wrapped around his neck.\n\nDuring her recent appearance on The Late Late Show With James Corben, the Kardashian matriarch took a lie detector test in front of the audience.\n\nKylie Jenner, 25, participated in the game and asked her mother: “Do you think Travis and Kourtney’s PDA is too much?”Kris, 66, hesitated before finally answering: “Once in a while.”\n\nJames, 44, was shocked when he discovered the Hulu star caught lying.\n\nHe asked: “What does that mean? Do you think it’s too much?”\n\nThe Kardashians star replied: “Once in a while, it’s too much.\n\nKris nervously laughed and continued: “I tried to say it as nice as possible!”\n\nKris’ dig at her daughter’s PDA lifestyle came as fans speculated a feud was brewing between Kourtney and the rest of the famous family.\n\nThe Sun exclusively revealed the TV personality’s plans for her new business venture and her secret partnership with Simon Huck.\n\nAfter working on the project for many years, Kourtney finally filed a trademark for Lemme on February 19, 2022.\n\nThe Poosh founder also announced her plans to venture into the skincare business, which will put her in direct competition with Kim’s SKKN line and Kylie’s Kylie Skin line.\n\nFans also noted that Kourtney was not among the guests at Kylie’s recent 25th birthday bash.\n\nWhile followers chatted about the rumored feud, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum was recently spotted strolling into the Moonlight Rollerskating

between the Spanish monarchy and the British monarchy\n\n5 ways to becoming a “Pro” with Professional EmailMusician Charlotte Lawrence is the LA 'it' girl you need on your radar.\n\nIt’s midday, the day after Charlotte Lawrence plays her debut London show and the curtains are still very much drawn as she emerges down the spiral staircase in her hotel room. <<|needle|>>After last night’s show Lawrence went out on a bender to celebrate with her team and one of her BFFs. <<|needle|>>She got back to the The Ned—the swanky former bank turned hotel in the City where she’s crashing—and had such a big headache that she couldn’t sleep, so she decided to watch Maleficent and fell asleep crying to the movie.\n\nLos Angeles born and raised Charlotte Lawrence is the daughter of actress Christa Miller (Cougar Town and Scrubs) and Bill Lawrence (the actual creator of Scrubs). <<|needle|>>Lawrence is still an LA girl and lives with her three dogs, including Beau the Pyrenees who is a puppy now but will eventually grow to be bigger than a human. <<|needle|>>You could say that a career in Hollywood was inevitable for Lawrence but she’ll tell you that she didn’t get a free pass just because of her parents, she’s been working at this “since little”.Wearing a Heron Preston NASA hoodie and eating roomservice pancakes and maple syrup, Lawrence tells it that she started singing at five years old, was trained classically in piano, self-taught at guitar and is currently learning the drums. <<|needle|>>Her parents are super creative but totally non-musical, so it was a big shock for them when Lawrence declared that she wanted to be a singer. <<|needle|>>By 11 years  old Lawrence wanted to start modelling and acting, but her parents were insistent she go to school—though they did let her cameo on an episode of Scrubs playing a younger version of her mum.\n\nThe first song Lawrence wrote was called “First Love”, she was nine years old and the first line went “You’ve crashed a ship in the sea of love / just to see what was up above / was it the sky or the look in your eyes?”. <<|needle|>>Lawrence laughs as she shares the story, calling it a “full-blown Titanic love song” despite the fact that, at that age, she didn’t even talk to boys ever. <<|needle|>>Since writing that first song she’s teamed up with Yungblud to record a track for season two of 13 Reasons Why, released her own six-track EP, featured in a Balmain campaign and scored a spot as the opening act for fellow rising star, Lauv.\n\nLawrence says the best thing about being a teenager is that she still has a working metabolism. <<|needle|>>The worst thing is that she “grew up very fast” and has always been around adults, so a bunch of her best friends are older, in their twenties or thirties—her Hollywood friend-set includes model/actress Kaia Gerber and Kit Keenan (daughter of Cynthia Rowley).\n\n“I hate when people are like ‘ah but she’s only 18, she’s still a teenager’, it’s like ‘no, I know the same shit as you, I’ve been through the the same shit as you, been living this fucking Hollywood crazy ass stupid life the same time as you’. <<|needle|>>I grew up in the heart of LA and I’ve been working and following my dreams since I was literally 13 years old,” insists Lawrence. <<|needle|>>“Sometimes I’ll still be viewed as ‘oh she’s still immature she doesn’t get it because she’s still young’ and it’s like ‘no dude, you don’t fucking get it!’.”Despite the fact that her friends are all successfully pursuing similar entertainment industry careers, Lawrence says that one of her best qualities is never feeling jealous of anybody. <<|needle|>>Instead she likes to surround herself with people of that same mindset that are all about the glow up and lifting each other up. <<|needle|>>“That’s the thing about L.A.,” Lawrence says, “you’ll meet the worst people you’ve ever met in your entire life, you’ll meet the fakest, worst social climbers ever, but you’ll also meet the best people you’ve ever met.”\n\nLawrence wouldn’t call herself Instafamous, she thinks that title means you’re more of an Instagram model or an influencer and instead thinks her follower count is a result of people liking her music. <<|needle|>>“I’d rather be known for my music in the real world than followed on Instagram,” she proclaims as we discuss how much social media has taken over and the warped perception of reality it gives people—something Lawrence acutely aware of being on the other side of the looking glass.\n\n“Everything’s public. <<|needle|>>Even if you don’t wanna be and I admit to it too. <<|needle|>>Everybody’s living a lie but you’re never going to post the really difficult shit on your fucking Instagram. <<|needle|>>Social media doesn’t affect me like that though, I’ve never viewed it as a lifestyle, I just view it as a marketing thing,” says Lawrence. <<|needle|>>“People in the middle of nowhere see it thinking it’s a literal reality—it’s curated.”Social media doesn’t give Lawrence anxiety but there are other things in life that do and Lawrence makes a point of writing about them in her music. <<|needle|>>Take “Keep Me Up”, the track Lawrence wrote 15 minutes after suffering from an anxiety attack in which she sings lines like “You’re keeping me awake at night / I’m losing all my appetite / My heart is beating out of time / My skin is cold. <<|needle|>>My chest is tight“ directly to her anxiety as a kind of therapy. <<|needle|>>Lawrence says, “By releasing that and putting it out into the world I want people to feel the same way, to view it as a sort of therapy as well, to be able to listen to it and say I felt that, I know what she’s talking about, this’ll help me, I’m not alone.”\n\nAnxiety isn’t the only issue Lawrence is outspoken on, describing herself as “personally and secretly very political”. <<|needle|>>Lawrence believes in gun control laws more than anything, calling it an obvious issue that can be easily fixed. <<|needle|>>Other issues like immigration and the separation of detained families are also vexing Lawrence:\n\n“Obviously there’s many wide scale issues that are very Republican versus Democrat ideals, that we’re not gonna be able to change, then there’s the smaller issues—don’t be a mean person or don’t separate children from their families, it’s blatantly a horrible thing to do, it’s not a Republican versus Democrat issue, that’s just home wrecking. <<|needle|>>It’s time for a new president,” Lawrence proclaims.\n\n“Hell yeah. <<|needle|>>I think feminist is a broad word—I do believe I’m a feminist but it’s another word that has a bad rep, that people will ‘strue and be like ‘oh feminist crazy, hate men’ and it’s like no I just believe in equal rights for all. <<|needle|>>But women are gonna fucking rule the world so.”<image>A Day In The Life With Charlotte LawrenceDark-pop supernova, Charlotte Lawrence, gives Notion an exclusive look into a day in her life as she films the music video for her new song \"Cowboy\" off her self-titled EP.5 Reasons to Go to Slovenia\n\nBordered by four more-popular countries—Italy, Croatia, Austria, and Hungary—Slovenia tends to be overlooked as a worthy destination. <<|needle|>>But this multicultural country has much to offer, from colossal caves and peaceful countryside gorges to hip cities like Ljubljana (pronounced “Loob-lee-ah-nah”). <<|needle|>>Here are five reasons to get your next passport stamp in Slovenia.Ljubljana, the country's capital, may be hard to say and spell, but it's easy to love. <<|needle|>>The most compelling reason can be found in its hipster quotient, which is on full display at BiKoFe Bar (Zidovska Steza 2) in the city's Old Town. <<|needle|>>It's here that local bands like the Vasko Atanasovski Trio play their Hava Nagila-meets-The Roots tunes outside on the cobblestoned corner, attracting such large crowds that the cops' arrival is inevitable. <<|needle|>>Throughout the easily walkable city, which is divided at the Triple Bridge near Preseren Square, graffiti adorns stone walls and contemporary art is on display at Mestna galerija Ljubljana (free entry). <<|needle|>>While there are produce markets to shop and a castle to visit at the top of town, you'd be forgiven for just sleeping late at the central and contemporary City Hotel (rooms from $100), then watching the passersby at a cool riverside cafe like TOZD (Gallusovo nabrezje 27).\n\nMake a Wish in the Middle of a LakeAn easy 40-minute bus ride from the capital takes you to this peaceful countryside resort town, which is most famous for its “Island” (Otok) in the center of Lake Bled. <<|needle|>>Reachable only by pletna (flat-bottomed, centuries-old wooden boats hand-steered by oarsmen), which can be hired for $16 round-trip, legend has it that if you ring the bell inside the castle's Church of the Assumption and make a wish, it'll come true. <<|needle|>>There are 98 steps leading up to the church, and for years grooms have been carrying brides up the steps to assure a long and happy life together. <<|needle|>>Alternatively, take a leisurely, three-mile walk around the lake just before sunset, when the views are the most stunning. <<|needle|>>Restaurants such as Okarina offer a personable, homey atmosphere with tasty food, while cozy hideaway Hotel Berc (rooms from $80) provides reasonable rooms above the lake (free bike rental and breakfast included). <<|needle|>>For those who have more to spend, try Vila Istra (rooms for $350) and wake up inside a fairytale.Influences from the four neighboring countries seep into Slovenia, predominantly evident in its food. <<|needle|>>But while gelato and Prsut (cured ham) are plentiful, its native sweets deserve the most attention. <<|needle|>>The decades-old Kremna rezina, found only in Bled, features a layer of cream and a thick layer of vanilla custard sandwiched between slices of thin crispy pastry. <<|needle|>>Each restaurant in town touts its own slice, but Park Hotel claims to have baked the original in 1953—and continues to turn out millions of “the best” bite around. <<|needle|>>The slice at small bakery Slascicarna Smon above town is a close second. <<|needle|>>Then, there's Prekmurska gibanica, a heftier sweet treat that features apples, raisins, and walnuts with ricotta filling. <<|needle|>>Try a piece at Gujzina (Mestni Trg 19) in Ljubljana and you won't need to eat for days.Known as “Little Plitvice,” Vintgar Gorge is a smaller version of Croatia's enormous Plitvice Lakes National Park and easily accessible from Lake Bled by foot, car, or bike. <<|needle|>>(Insider tip: Go by two wheels. <<|needle|>>From Bled, you'll ride about two miles through wide-open fields of dandelions with views of the Julian Alps in the background.) This beautiful park with a mere $5 entrance fee is quiet, unpopulated, and completely underrated. <<|needle|>>You'll spend at least a couple of hours traipsing over its wooden planks and narrow walkways that twist and turn along a mile-long pathway en route to a breathtaking waterfall. <<|needle|>>Walk back the same way, or continue hiking behind the small cafe and bathroom towards Katarina Bled for a half-hour hike back into town.\n\nGet Lost in The UndergroundVenture about 90 minutes by rail from Ljubljana into Slovenia's Karst region to marvel at the vast canyons and rushing underground river of Skocjan Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. <<|needle|>>Recently renovated in 2011, the site now sees nearly 100,000 visitors a year. <<|needle|>>While a guided tour is mandatory and takes about two hours to complete, the $20 ticket is well worth the Indiana Jones-esque adventure. <<|needle|>>Hold onto your hat while looking up at the limestone formations in the canyons and taverns—it's a long way down.\n\nSara Lieberman is a journalist based in New York City. <<|needle|>>Her work has appeared in Hemispheres, Rhapsody, the Daily Beast, Page Six Magazine and more. <<|needle|>>Her musings on self-discovery while discovering the world can be found on her blog, News Girl About Towns.The Curiosity rover has nearly crossed a stretch of the roughest terrain it’s seen during its 44 months on Mars. <<|needle|>>Scientists are monitoring the wear and tear on the rover’s wheels.\n\nExplore this Mars panorama in 360-degrees by moving the view with your mouse or mobile device. <<|needle|>>This mid-afternoon, 360-degree panorama was acquired by the Mast Camera (Mastcam) on NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover on April 4, 2016. <<|needle|>>The scene is presented with a color adjustment that approximates white balancing, to resemble how the rocks and sand would appear under daytime lighting conditions on Earth.\n\nNASA’s Curiosity Mars rover has nearly finished crossing the Naukluft Plateau, the most rugged and difficult-to-navigate terrain encountered during the mission’s 44 months on Mars. <<|needle|>>The terrain’s roughness raised concern that driving on it could be especially damaging to Curiosity’s wheels, according to a statement from NASA/JPL on April 27, 2016.<image>Image taken from the Mastcam on NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover shows the rugged surface of the Naukluft Plateau, plus upper Mount Sharp at right and part of the rim of Gale Crater. <<|needle|>>Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nThe rover climbed onto the Naukluft Plateau of lower Mount Sharp in early March, 2016 after spending several weeks investigating sand dunes. <<|needle|>>The plateau’s sandstone bedrock has been carved by eons of wind erosion into ridges and knobs. <<|needle|>>The path of about a quarter mile (400 meters) westward across it is taking Curiosity toward smoother surfaces leading to geological layers of scientific interest farther uphill.\n\nThe roughness of the terrain on the plateau raised concern that driving on it could be especially damaging to Curiosity’s wheels, as was terrain Curiosity crossed before reaching the base of Mount Sharp. <<|needle|>>Holes and tears in the rover’s aluminum wheels became noticeable in 2013. <<|needle|>>The rover team responded by adjusting the long-term traverse route, revising how local terrain is assessed and refining how drives are planned. <<|needle|>>Extensive Earth-based testing provided insight into wheel longevity.The team operating NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover uses the MAHLI camera on the rover’s arm to check the condition of the wheels at routine intervals. <<|needle|>>Each of Curiosity’s six wheels is about 20 inches (50 centimeters) in diameter and 16 inches (40 centimeters) wide, milled out of solid aluminum. <<|needle|>>Most of the wheel’s circumference is a metallic skin that is about half the thickness of a U.S. <<|needle|>>dime. <<|needle|>>Nineteen zigzag-shaped treads, called grousers, extend about a quarter inch (three-fourths of a centimeter) outward from the skin of each wheel. <<|needle|>>The grousers bear much of the rover’s weight and provide most of the traction and ability to traverse over uneven terrain. <<|needle|>>The holes seen in the wheels so far perforate only the skin. <<|needle|>>Wheel-monitoring images obtained every 547 yards (500 meters) have not yet shown any grouser breaks on Curiosity. <<|needle|>>Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nInspection of the wheels after crossing most of the Naukluft Plateau has indicated that, while the terrain presented challenges for navigation, driving across it did not accelerate damage to the wheels.Steve Lee is Curiosity’s deputy project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. <<|needle|>>Lee said:\n\nWe carefully inspect and trend the condition of the wheels. <<|needle|>>Cracks and punctures have been gradually accumulating at the pace we anticipated, based on testing we performed at JPL. <<|needle|>>Given our longevity projections, I am confident these wheels will get us to the destinations on Mount Sharp that have been in our plans since before landing.\n\nThe next part of the rover’s route will return to a type of lake-deposited mudstone surface examined previously. <<|needle|>>Farther ahead on lower Mount Sharp are three geological units that have been key destinations for the mission since its landing site was selected. <<|needle|>>One of the units contains an iron-oxide mineral called hematite, which was detected from orbit. <<|needle|>>Just above it lies a band rich in clay minerals, then a series of layers that contain sulfur-bearing minerals called sulfates. <<|needle|>>By examining them with Curiosity, researchers hope to gain a better understanding of how long ancient environmental conditions remained favorable for microbial life, if it was ever present on Mars, before conditions became drier and less favorable.\n\nAt a current odometry of 7.9 miles (12.7 kilometers) since its August 2012 landing, Curiosity’s wheels are projected to have more than enough life remaining to investigate the hematite, clay and sulfate units ahead, even in the unlikely case that up to three grousers break soon. <<|needle|>>The driving distance to the start of the sulfate-rich layers is roughly 4.7 miles (7.5 kilometers) from the rover’s current location.This early-morning view from the Mastcam on NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover on March 16, 2016, covers a portion of the inner wall of Gale Crater. <<|needle|>>At right, the image fades into glare of the rising sun. <<|needle|>>Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nOn Naukluft Plateau, the rover’s Mast Camera has recorded some panoramic scenes from the highest viewpoints Curiosity has reached since its August 2012 landing on the floor of Gale Crater on Mars. <<|needle|>>See examples here and here.\n\nBottom line: NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover has nearly finished crossing the Naukluft Plateau, the most rugged and difficult-to-navigate terrain encountered during the mission’s 44 months on Mars. <<|needle|>>The terrain’s roughness raised concern that driving on it could be especially damaging to Curiosity’s wheels, according to a statement from NASA/JPL on April 27, 2016.Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, seeing others in masks has become commonplace. <<|needle|>>But have you seen a runner sporting a mask that makes them look a little bit like Darth Vader?\n\nThese face coverings, often called altitude or elevation masks, are training tools that claim to come with some benefits, like improving lung capacity and oxygen efficiency by restricting your airflow as you run. <<|needle|>>But do they really work?\n\nJoin Runner's World+ for unlimited access to the best training tips for runners.\n\nWhile these devices are often called high altitude or high elevation training masks, those names are a bit of a misnomer.\n\nWhen you go from sea level to elevation (or New York City to Boulder, CO, for example), there’s less atmospheric pressure—which causes the total content of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen in the air to drop—and less partial pressure of oxygen, explains Porcari.\n\nTraining in those conditions—training at altitude—causes increased production of a hormone called erythropoietin (or EPO), which triggers your body to produce more red blood cells and form new blood vessels. <<|needle|>>That means your body can deliver more oxygen to your muscles, which means you can run faster and more efficiently, especially when you return to sea level.\n\nTraining masks, which typically feature one to three valves or vents, merely affect how hard it is for you to breathe—they do not affect the mix of gases in the air that you’re breathing, says Arent.\n\n“Imagine you’re breathing through a vacuum hose, then a garden hose, then a straw, and then a cocktail straw. <<|needle|>>It’s going to get harder to breathe,” says Porcari. <<|needle|>>That’s essentially what a training mask does: reduce the amount of airflow into the lungs. <<|needle|>>So, unfortunately, you’re not going to get the same benefits that you would from training at elevation.\n\nSo, why would you ese one of these?\n\nThat’s not to say a training mask doesn’t have any benefits. <<|needle|>>Restricting the amount of air you breathe is called inspiratory muscle training; it’s often used by people with asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema. <<|needle|>>But it could benefit runners as well. <<|needle|>>“You’re basically increasing the strength of your respiratory muscles, which could mean you’re bringing more air into your lungs,” explains Porcari. <<|needle|>>“Then, you’ve potentially got more oxygen that can get into your bloodstream.” The more oxygen you can get to your muscles, the easier exercise will feel.\n\nPorcari—in conjunction with the American Council of Exercise—tested the effect of training while wearing the Elevation Training Mask 2.0. <<|needle|>>He found that those who wore a mask showed a 15-percent increase in ventilatory threshold (a.k.a. <<|needle|>>the point at which your breathing starts to increase) and respiratory compensation threshold (a.k.a. <<|needle|>>the point at which lactate accumulates at faster rates than the body can remove it—or the highest sustainable level of exercise intensity).\n\nThose things could have a bigger influence on performance. <<|needle|>>Let’s say a runner can run eight miles per hour before they hit their respiratory compensation threshold; if they can improve that threshold by 15 percent, they’ll be able to run 9.2 miles per hour—that’s a huge difference. <<|needle|>>But more research has to be done to replicate Porcari’s findings.\n\nFrom an anecdotal standpoint, training masks might help you breathe better on the run, says Arent. <<|needle|>>“People I know who’ve used these devices have said it makes them breathe less with their chest and more with their diaphragm, which would be a good thing,” he says. <<|needle|>>If you’re breathing with your chest, you’re only using a small portion of your lungs, which forces you to take more breaths to get enough oxygen; when you breathe deeper into your diaphragm, you can take fewer breaths while getting more oxygen into the deeper parts of your lungs. <<|needle|>>It’s more efficient, and it will help control your heart rate—which puts less stress on your body so you can run faster and longer without fatigue.\n\nShould you buy a high altitude mask?\n\nIt’s not necessary. <<|needle|>>“There’s not a huge upside to wearing a training mask, especially if you’re fairly highly trained,” says Arent. <<|needle|>>Despite the ventilatory and respiratory compensation threshold benefits, you likely won’t see massive performance changes. <<|needle|>>And, for most people, the pulmonary system is rarely the limiting factor in endurance exercise, Arent adds—it’s more likely to be your musculoskeletal or cardiovascular system.\n\nOf course, using a training mask will elevate the relative intensity of a workout because it will make breathing more difficult, says Arent. <<|needle|>>“There are times in training when suffering isn’t such a bad thing,” he says. <<|needle|>>“It’s a non-optimal condition that forces adaptation.”\n\nBut it’s not an everyday training device; rather, it’s something you might want to incorporate every once in a while if you’re looking for an added challenge, says Arent.\n\nIf you're intrigued, there’s no real harm in trying one (so long as you don’t have any pre-existing conditions and you get approval from your doctor or health professional) except of course, the price tag: They retail between around $20 and $100.\n\nTo test it, “you may want to start wearing it on shorter runs, then add it into longer runs and go from there,” says Porcari. <<|needle|>>“You should build up to higher intensities.”\n\nJust don’t expect it to be a magic bullet. <<|needle|>>A good interval or tempo workout can be just as challenging as an easy run with a mask on—and potentially more beneficial.The latest iteration of the OG training mask lets you easily adjust the air flow via a dial on the single vent.For those on a budget, this altitude training mask will work in a pinch.The ergonomic, slip-resistant design makes this mask a comfortable fit on even the longest runs.This choice is comfortable and skin-tight, promising no looseness or extra noise.For those interested in getting to know Emma Frost, I've handpicked some fan favorite issues in canonical order, and scans are included for viewing pleasure. <<|needle|>>This recommendation list should give any a fan a good idea of the powerful character that Emma Frost is.\n\nEmma Frost #1, #6\nWriter: Karl Bollers\nArtist: Randall Green\nThe first issue sets the basis for Emma's childhood and the close relationship she had with her brother, Christian, who was later kicked out of the house in issue #6 in which she rejected her father's inheritence and left the Frost household to make it out her own way.<image>The \"Emma Frost\" series was published in 2003 - obviously, way after her first appearance. <<|needle|>>Although Emma gave some back-history in \"Generation X\" #24, Grant Morrison fleshed out her background in \"New X-Men\" #139 during a flashback and this series provided further explanation. <<|needle|>>Actually, Emma's history in which she explained her parents sent her to a mental hospital in \"Generation X\" #24 was retconned in the \"Emma Frost\" series. <<|needle|>>It was her brother who went to the mental hospital.\nSingle issues should still be about the same as the cover price. <<|needle|>>The \"Emma Frost\" series, which runs in 3 volumes, are collected in digests for about $7.99 each.\nClassic X-Men #7\nWriter: Chris Claremont\nArtist: Dave Cockrum\nEmma Frost, the new White Queen of the Hellfire Club, alongside Sebastian Shaw, the new Black King plot the takeover of the Hellfire Club, which was run by humans with anti-mutant sentiments. <<|needle|>>Emma Frost plays a pivotal role in this transition, where her telepathy plays a key part.\nThe \"Classic X-Men\" series served as a reprint of - well - classic X-Men issues. <<|needle|>>This issue reprints \"Uncanny X-Men #99.\" Usually at the end of each issue was a backstory explaining the history of the original issue. <<|needle|>>Emma Frost has a beautiful pinup drawn by John Bolton in the back cover of issue #7:Issue #129 serves as Emma Frost's official first appearance, along with Kitty Pryde and Sebastian Shaw. <<|needle|>>I believe this issue runs around $50, so you can grab the Dark Phoenix Saga TPB, which collects issues #129 - #137, for much less than $50. <<|needle|>>Emma plays a large role until she gets taken out by Jean Grey/Phoenix in issue #131.\nFirestar #2\nWriter: Tom Defalco\nArtist: Mary Wilshire\nEmma commits her most ultimate evil act in which she telepathically kills Firestar's horse, Butter Rum, to manipulate the girl into being more responsible. <<|needle|>>The horror - it's almost funny. <<|needle|>>OK, it's hilarious and every Emma fan gets a kick out of this issue.Firestar and Emma Frost's feud did not end in that series, though. <<|needle|>>In \"New Warriors\" #10, Emma and the Hellions fought Firestar's team and tried to recruit her again. <<|needle|>>At the end, Emma told the young girl she'd one day be sorry for her wrong ideology because Emma actually believed her ideology was the right one. <<|needle|>>Later in \"Generation X\" #59, it's Emma who apologizes to Firestar. <<|needle|>>Just recently, they met again in \"Young Allies\" #6. <<|needle|>>Emma offers Firestar a place in Utopia, but she rejects the offer and the two part respectfully.\nIf you want to read the entire \"Firestar\" miniseries in which Emma also plays a main role, pick up the \"Firestar Digest\" for $7.99.\nGeneration X #1, #70, #75\nWriter: Bryan Wood, Warren Ellis\nArtist: Steve PughAfter Emma's Hellions died, the Professor offered her to teach a new generation of mutants. <<|needle|>>Emma and Banshee started the school, taking several young mutants under their wing. <<|needle|>>The school ran successfully until it had financial troubles in which Emma's sister Adrienne became involved to help fund the school.\nBut if you think Emma is the craziest of the Frost family, you're wrong. <<|needle|>>Adrienne Frost plants bombs at Emma's school and kills the student Synch in the process. <<|needle|>>Always overprotective of her students, Emma finally dukes it out with her sister and ends up killing her with a gun. <<|needle|>>Yes, this could be considered another evil act of Emma, but I can't say Adrienne didn't deserve it.\nNew X-Men #116, #138 - #140, #150, #154, New X-Men Annual 2001\nWriter: Grant Morrison\nArtist: Frank Quitely\n\"New X-Men\" #116 is packed with the glamour of Emma Frost. <<|needle|>>Emma gets her secondary mutation. <<|needle|>>Emma explains to Jean why she's such a bitch. <<|needle|>>And Emma joins the X-Men, telling Scott she only came back for her Louis Vuitton. <<|needle|>>Grant Morrison sets up this issue with Emma as the star character and just a preview for the awesomeness that she is in the rest of his run.Emma's infamous psychic affair with Scott of all people starts the \"New X-Men Annual 2001,\" issue #131 and continues in issues #138 - #140. <<|needle|>>Issues #150 and #154 are also important, where Xorn breaks hell on the X-Men, and Scott and Emma decide to start up the X-Men again in #154.\nPick up all 7 volumes. <<|needle|>>This is the series that turned Emma into one of the most popular X-Men in the comics right now.\nAstonishing X-Men #1, #2, #12 - #17, Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men #1\nWriter: Joss Whedon\nArtist: John Cassaday\nJoss Whedon's Emma Frost retains the wit of Morrison's Emma while making her especially distant - and that distance has to do with the weird voices Emma has been hearing. <<|needle|>>Because of her odd behavior, most of the X-Men don't trust her, not even Scott. <<|needle|>>It all starts rolling downhill in the Torn arc (#13 - #17), which turns into one of the best stories I've ever read in the X-Men.\nWhedon takes everything from Emma's past and, most notably, Morrison's run by adding layers to her psyche. <<|needle|>>You get to see what really makes Emma tick, as well as the rest of the characters on the team too.\nOh, did I mention the dynamics of Emma and Kitty both on a team? Their past, in which both characters are disturbed about, is frequently brought up, and it plays out wonderfully.Whedon's Astonishing X-Men is collected in four volumes. <<|needle|>>It wouldn't hurt to buy all those either.\nX-Men: Legacy #216\nWriter: Mike Carey\nArtist: Phil Briones\nHypocritical of Emma to be lecturing Xavier about his past? Yes, however, she does this because she feels this is the best way to probe for any signs of Sinister in his mind. <<|needle|>>At the same time, she acknowledges a telepath's wrongdoings are far greater because of the power they possess.<image>The issue is a great showcase of Emma's telepathic talents as well. <<|needle|>>Xavier is in her mind and not his, yet she is still able to walk through his past.\nWell, that's all! Emma has become an increasingly popular character and is currently one of the main characters in \"Astonishing X-Men\" and \"Uncanny X-Men.\" She's also a character in \"X-Men: First Class,\" which hits theatres June 3, and is being played by Mad Men's January Jones.\nBuying all these issues on one shopping day isn't quite a feasible option for most people, so if you want just the nitty gritty, pick up some of Morrison's \"New X-Men\" and Whedon's \"Astonishing X-Men\" - in my opinion, some of the best Emma stuff you can read.\nIf you're ever curious, check out Nikbackm's Google spreadsheet of every issue she's appeared in: Emma Frost Comic Appearances.\nIf you have any questions, just drop a comment.\n-AimeeOPEC could be nearing a deal that could help support battered oil prices.\n\nKhalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia's energy minister, said on Friday that OPEC is close to agreeing to extend production cuts, Reuters reported. <<|needle|>>Those cuts, led by Saudi Arabia, are due to expire at the end of June.\n\nHowever, the Saudi official cautioned that more time could be needed to convince non-OPEC allies such as Russia to extend the agreement.\n\nThat news initially lifted US oil prices, which surged as much as 2.4% to $53.83 a barrel early on Friday.\n\nHowever, most of those gains vanished, with crude recently trading roughly flat on the day at $52.64 a barrel.\n\nThe oil market has been slammed in recent weeks by economic worries. <<|needle|>>Those concerns were not helped by Friday's jobs report, which showed that payroll growth slowed sharply to 75,000 in May.\n\nUS oil plunged back into a bear market -- its second in seven months -- on Wednesday following a report that revealed a spike in crude inventories.US stocks kicked the day off higher on Friday despite a jobs report with a lower-than-expected headline number. <<|needle|>>75,000 jobs were added in May, compared with the 185,000 consensus forecast from Refinitiv. <<|needle|>>Stock futures pares their gains after the report came out but then recovered.\n\nAll three indexes are on track to finish the week higher. <<|needle|>>The Dow is looking to snap a six week losing streak, while the S&P and Nasdaq had previously been down for four weeks in a row.\n\nCNN Business' Christine Romans said the slowdown in job growth for May might be because of tariffs, which could be \"denting confidence.\"\n\nRomans points out the May number is even smaller, with 75,000 jobs being added. <<|needle|>>That was below expectations.\n\n\"Something happened there with business confidence and that stalled business hiring,\" she said.\n\nWatch her full analysis from CNN Newsroom below.The US economy added only 75,000 jobs in May, a surprisingly low number that was well below what experts had predicted.\n\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate remained at 3.6%, meaning that joblessness is still hovering near a half-century low.\n\nThe report supports suspicions that the labor market is finally slowing down from its blistering pace in 2018, with revisions to the past two months subtracting 75,000 jobs. <<|needle|>>Employers have added 164,000 jobs per month on average in 2019, compared with 223,000 jobs per month last year.US stock futures cut back some of their gains after the release of the jobs report.\n\nFutures for the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite pared their gains after the release of the report.Its earnings and revenue both beat analysts' expectations. <<|needle|>>Zoom also expects to have a strong second quarter.\n\nIf the premarket gains hold,

<<|needle|>>However, talks will continue that \"could soon lead to a higher offer.\"\n\nBoth companies' stocks are up roughly 3% in premarket trading.<image>US stock futures point to another day of

of 263,000.\n\nHowever, adding that many jobs would still represent very healthy growth, especially given that unemployment is sitting at a 49-year low of 3.6%. <<|needle|>>Wages gains are expected to be flat, at about 3.2% over the previous year.\n\nA clean bill of health for the labor market could ease Wall Street's concerns about slowing economic growth.By Wouter B.\nAutumn may be upon us, but some of refuse to accept the downward spiral of the suns’ rythm. <<|needle|>>Set in the deep and darkened forests of Oisterwijk (near Tilburg, NL) a special three day festival of black metal of various forms was organized, as part of the larger Incubate 2015 festival. <<|needle|>>The venue is called ‘The Natuurtheater’ which is a fitting setting for a black & death metal evening in nature. <<|needle|>>This may well be the last spasm of the open air plays of this year, but hell, a spasm with a kick!After a long and somewhat deviated drive to get press entrance, I found myself enjoying a cold beer in the secluded woods around The Natuurtheater. <<|needle|>>The area was made up of a quarter circle amphitheater including (ugly plastic ex-stadium) chairs to sit on. <<|needle|>>As I only had the time to visit one day, I choose the Friday given the line-up.Opening band Emptiness had their name written over the theater as the amount of people watching the show was low. <<|needle|>>Playing a mix of atmospheric doom with a bit of drone, the music felt a bit repetitive and out of place. <<|needle|>>While not familiar with their work, I guess the music would have been better enjoyed in the dark.\n\nA pleasant surprise came with German occult doom/death ensemble Nechros Christos with their hooking but eerie riffs, ripping out pieces of your body. <<|needle|>>Slightly outlandish for European standards, using Arabic influenced rhythms, which can be a welcome change to the ever present (standard?) blast-beat death metal.\n\nAfter a quick coffee and/or beer at the local forest pub (invaded by many a blackened soul) the almost surreal Swiss band Bölzer was next. <<|needle|>>Consisting of solely a (rather huge) guitarist/vocalist and drummer, this was a real spectacle to watch. <<|needle|>>The epic and atmospheric music, with its intricate and complex layers, emanating from the stage entranced many of the by now filled crowd. <<|needle|>>Wow, great play!“Clandestine is the art of the Daemon…” I confess to being slightly if not hugely enthusiastic about Alex von Meilenwalds’ (ex-Nagelfar) The Ruins of Beverast (as you may have seen in the PartySan 2015 review). <<|needle|>>I couldn’t wait to see them (yet) again in this befitting venue. <<|needle|>>Setting a stage with both (traditional?) black metal as well as heavy stretched base lines, these guys managed a very haunting atmosphere. <<|needle|>>This did well for the long symphonies portraying and ridiculing the evil that mankind does. <<|needle|>>Although the sound was, in contrast to PartySan, a bit bad (too loud, negligible distinction between guitars, inaudible keyboard), Alex’ grand nightmarish voice from hell and the overall experience made this another ‘want more and longer’ play by The Ruins.“Freedom is the Serpent!” Headliner Secrets of The Moon are likewise something special to me, with their eclectic tight riffing and elite occult aura. <<|needle|>>Straight from opener Serpent Messiah, these Munich/Hamburg (DE) based maniacs set down a superb performance. <<|needle|>>Contrary to Ruins, the sound was very good (if still too loud). <<|needle|>>Stageplay by both sG (vocal) and Ar (guitar, also live for Ruins) was very animated, almost infectious. <<|needle|>>Must-play (and must-see) Lucifer Speaks, supported by dual a vocalist (Rogier Droog, Bethlehem) was an animate display of this bands’ ‘life song’. <<|needle|>>New and atmospheric songs of upcoming record Sun (release 4th of December) Hole and I Took the Sky Away were granted unto us, while the slower and bass heavy Million Suns was not forgotten either. <<|needle|>>Holy Odin/Satan/[fill in your favorite deity], what a gigantic play. <<|needle|>>Carved in Stigmata Wounds ended what for me was possibly be the best concert of 2015!\n\nA big thumbs-up to the organization of Incubate 2015, for organizing an event in the middle of the woods. <<|needle|>>I will be there again next year!Time for a little Arts and Crafts…The Dallas Federation of Women’s Clubs (DFWC), originally named the City Federation of Women’s Clubs, was created in 1898 as the consolidation of five existing women’s cultural and literary clubs. <<|needle|>>At the general meeting on November 3, 1931, the federation entertained a recommendation for the formation of the Three Arts Study Club, a new women’s literary group whose focus was programming on art, music, and literature.<image>Several years later, in 1953, the Junior Three Arts Study Club was formed by and for the daughters and daughters-in-law of the senior club members. <<|needle|>>Their purpose, too,   was to study music, art, and literature. <<|needle|>>The group also provided social activities and fundraising events for its members in Dallas, Texas and surrounding areas. <<|needle|>>The tree emblem illustrates the many limbs that grow from the three main branches of the arts: literature, art, and music.\n\nTalks and meetings took place in members’ homes on the second Wednesday of each month. <<|needle|>>During the inaugural year, the group heard from another notable speaker/scholar in the archives of women of the Southwest: Ermance Rejebian. <<|needle|>>Not only did members study the arts, some were talented artists themselves as seen in this piece from a club member in 1953:The 10th anniversary banquet took place at the Metropolitan Savings and Loan Building off of Preston and Forest. <<|needle|>>The theme was the Old South, and women and men dressed in period clothing, while southern music and decorations lined the hall. <<|needle|>>In 2003, the group celebrated their 50th anniversary.If you’ve loved streaming anime on NarutoSpot and are seeking for Naruspot Alternatives , you’ve come to

significant religious event in Hinduism. <<|needle|>>Auspicious tasks such as Puja recitation, conducting Hawans and events such as Mundan ceremony are carried out on this day. <<|needle|>>One gains riddance from ten different types of sins performed by a native in his/her life knowingly or unknowingly.\n\nIt is believed that anything donated must be ten in quantity. <<|needle|>>According to the Puranas, Ganga descended on the Earth on this day, so bathing in the river Ganges is also considered very auspicious. <<|needle|>>But this year, it won’t happen due to the ongoing nationwide pandemic. <<|needle|>>Hence, you can mix the Gangajal available at home with your bathing water and venerate Maa Ganga with devotion. <<|needle|>>Worshiping the Ganges on the day of Ganga Dussehra helps one attain salvation.* By bathing in any river and performing charitable activities, a native gets rid of his/her ten sins carried out knowingly or unknowingly. <<|needle|>>With the elimination of ten sins, this date is famously known as Ganga Dussehra.\n\n* Donating Sattu, Matka or a Large Earthen Pot and Hand Fan on this day helps to gain auspicious results.* On the day of Ganga Dussehra, the number of things that the devotees donate should be at least ten. <<|needle|>>Similarly, they must use anything in a quantity of ten to perform the rituals.How cold is too cold to run?

I think it comes down to personal preference and also knowing what your limits are. <<|needle|>>If you’re a healthy individual and you go for regular check-ups then you will be the only one that knows your own limits. <<|needle|>>After doing some research on the internet I’ve come up with the potential benefits and risk factors to running in the cold.\n\nPros of Running in the coldI’m a big believer in doing things that suck and testing my limits. <<|needle|>>Doing the stuff that I don’t want to do has made me a stronger and happier person overall.\n\nWhen you’re sitting at home in your warm home and your wife is making some warm biscuits and you’re wearing your favorite sweater the last thing you want to do is go for a run in the cold. <<|needle|>>However, if you do end up going for that run and especially after telling yourself that you didn’t want to do it your brain is shocked.\n\nYour brain starts thinking that this might become the norm, and when you keep tricking your brain like this eventually you will re-program your mental fortitude to be stronger and do other things in your life that also suck, helping you grow as a person. <<|needle|>>This is a point I’ve learned from one of my favorite runners, David Goggins.\n\n2. <<|needle|>>You can continue running outdoors\n\nMost of you that have landed on this article are people that likely love to run outdoors, you don’t want to go to the gym and be stuck on the treadmill. <<|needle|>>You’re likely a runner that runs through the rain as well and quite like it in fact. <<|needle|>>You don’t want to compromise and you want to continue running outdoors. <<|needle|>>By running in the cold (And getting accustomed to it where it’s now the norm) you are training your body to be able to handle it on a regular basis. <<|needle|>>Before long, you’ll be continuing your running regime outdoors all year long.\n\nYour body works harder to keep your core temperature up whilst you’re out in the cold. <<|needle|>>“Our bodies use a considerable amount of energy to keep us warm and humidify the air we breathe when we’re out in the cold” mentions Stacy Tucker a natural health expert and founder of Almeda Labs.\n\n4. <<|needle|>>Helps those with allergies\n\nIf you’re anything like me and have a ton of allergies, then you’re in for a treat because pollen counts are practically nonexistent in cold weather (And especially around snow).\n\nWe’ve all used an ice pack before to decrease swelling after an injury, this is because ice reduces inflammation and for that reason, the cold can do the same. <<|needle|>>A lot of people boast a lot on the benefits of cold exposure, one such person is Wim Hof, also known as The Iceman. <<|needle|>>Wim Hof has numerous world records in cold exposure and has run up Everest in just his underwear. <<|needle|>>Crazy right? Well, he talks more in-depth about how the cold can reduce inflammation and seems to think that it provides many other benefits as well. <<|needle|>>Look into him, I promise it’ll be a treat.\n\nCons of Running in the coldHypothermia is when the body loses heat faster than it can produce heat which in turn causes a dangerously low body temperature. <<|needle|>>Several symptoms of hypothermia are shivering, shallow breathing, weak pulse, confusion or bright red and cold skin.\n\nThe typical causes are wearing clothes that aren’t warm enough for the conditions you’re in, staying in the cold too long or jumping into something like ice water.\n\nThis can happen quite easily at cold Ironman events where you have to swim for several hours before you actually transition on a bike. <<|needle|>>With running, as long as you’re wearing adequate clothing you should be fine. <<|needle|>>However, needless to say, this doesn’t mean that the risk isn’t there, it’s just lower.\n\nFrostbite is a condition in which skin and the tissue below the skin freeze. <<|needle|>>This would normally affect small parts of the body such as your fingers and toes (Which are also the most prone to cold). <<|needle|>>Your skin will get cold, then numb and finally hard and pale. <<|needle|>>Most cases of frostbite which are mild in nature can be treated by warming the area however severe cases will require medical care. <<|needle|>>Frostbite is something that occurs in really cold temperatures and can be avoided in most cases if you wear adequate clothing.\n\nThe cold usually makes us tighter around our joints and muscles. <<|needle|>>This can be avoided with a proper warm-up regime, however. <<|needle|>>When exercising or running in the cold you should always make sure that you’ve done some light stretches and warming up before heading out for the run.\n\nIn the cold, the pavement and the ice that’s built up around is a risk factor that shouldn’t be overlooked. <<|needle|>>You run the risk of getting an injury after falling down so you need to make sure that you’ve got the right gear and equipment for running in the cold such as the right running shoes.\n\nSo how do you decide when it’s too cold to run outside? As mentioned before it’s definitely a personal preference. <<|needle|>>However, in saying that most runners and athletes will sound a similar tune. <<|needle|>>That is that it is dependent on the wind chill factor outside.\n\nThe wind chill takes into account conditions such as wind speed and moisture. <<|needle|>>“Say the thermometer reads 36 degrees Fahrenheit; if the wind chill says 20 degrees, your exposed skin will freeze as if it were 20 degrees-an crucial distinction for anyone going outside for more than a few minutes,” says Brian Schulz, M.D, an orthopedic surgeon/sports medicine specialist at Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in LA.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the matter? Have you found some research that states otherwise or have you ever run in the cold yourself?

Don’t feed them. <<|needle|>>When you feed a wild animal, you might as well poison it, as our processed stuff is toxic for them.<image>It is a magical sight. <<|needle|>>You see them in the rainforest, they are quite big, iridescent, and gorgeous. <<|needle|>>On one side they are brown and black with quite distinctive eye shape decorations on the other side they are absolutely breathtaking. <<|needle|>>Like fairies in the forest, they shine and disappear, just to shine again!\n\nAs small as interesting, in Costa Rica, there are over a hundred species of bats, that you can easily spot flying at night around the gardens of hotels. <<|needle|>>However, int he daytime, ask your guides to show them to you. <<|needle|>>Mostly all lodges and even resorts have areas where bats like to sleep the day becoming an -easy to spot- super interesting mammal.Really small (Less than half an inch in some cases) these bright frogs can be easily seen in any humid rainforests of the country, usually at the bottom of trees by the edge of rivers. <<|needle|>>Their distinctive mating call makes them an easy target to spot.Two species; the American Crocodile and the Spectacled Cayman. <<|needle|>>Both can be easily seen on large rivers or canals like Tortuguero, Tempisque or the famous Tarcoles River in the Central Pacific Area.There are several species of dolphins, the most common is the Spotted Dolphin and the Bottle Nosed Dolphin. <<|needle|>>In whales, the most common to see at certain times of the year (Ask our travel consultants about the best times to see them, and where) are the Humpback Whales although at times you can also spot Pilot Whales and even orcas.Yes, yes, I am in Michigan again. <<|needle|>>This is my third trip out here now, the second in the continuing mission to find a place to live. <<|needle|>>Some possibilities have finally turned up, and I suppose one can live anywhere for a year or two.\n\nBut, instead of dwelling on that, I thought I'd share some of the scenes I have seen these last few days, starting with this very interesting bridge in Toledo, Ohio.Now, one really shouldn't be looking through the viewfinder of one's camera while one is driving, especially on a major highway. <<|needle|>>Still, I really wanted to get a photo of the suspension (?) structure of the bridge, and this one shot (above) just didn't capture it.\n\nSo, after I fiddled with the camera to try and get a setting, I finally just had to aim out the window and hope for the best - blind photography. <<|needle|>>It really is a visually stunning structure.I've been in MI now for four days, each day seeing me on the streets and roads and calling rental agencies in search of a dwelling. <<|needle|>>In between the viewings, however, I've taken in some of the sights of Jackson.\n\nThis really is a rather fascinating city, with a diverse and rich history. <<|needle|>>Sadly, it seems that most of the industry has folded or moved out of town, leaving many empty factories, vacant lots, and much unemployment.\n\nStill, there remains plenty to see and do.\n\nOne of the attractions, which is closed for the season, is The Cascades. <<|needle|>>I heard about this last week from one of the VIC volunteers who has traveled out here with his family. <<|needle|>>It is a series of man-made waterfalls, built on a man-made hill. <<|needle|>>At the very bottom of the fall it looked like there is an amphitheater of sorts; I imagine that in the summer there are shows here featuring the falls.\n\nThe afternoon I stopped by, there was no water and no visitors. <<|needle|>>Everything was locked away behind a prison-like chainlink fence with barbed wire along the top. <<|needle|>>The fence is the reason for the grey blurs in the photo below.\n\nThe next afternoon I drove around the more scenic rural countryside over toward the charming little village of Concord. <<|needle|>>It had been raining off and on, and dark clouds dashed across the sky, letting the sun peek out at intervals.\n\nThis part of Michigan has a few very low and gently rolling hills, but even so, flatness and great expanses of sky are emphasized, especially where large agricultural fields are the norm.\n\nIn this particular field, the cattle had been turned loose post corn harvest.\n\nMost of the animals didn't even bat an ear in my direction. <<|needle|>>Only a few looked up in curiosity.<image>This one however, really didn't know what to make of me. <<|needle|>>When I parked the car along the roadside, he was grazing right at the edge of the fence. <<|needle|>>Then I started to walk towards him. <<|needle|>>PANIC! He looked up, and bolted at high speed. <<|needle|>>He didn't go too far before he turned around to see just what it was that was possibly going to attack. <<|needle|>>I took his photo and reassured him that I was no threat. <<|needle|>>Meanwhile, a couple sandhill cranes croaked in the background. <<|needle|>>I looked for them, but they remained invisible. <<|needle|>>I learned last night that the count over at Hahnley Audubon Sanctuary a few days ago was over 5000 cranes - a record.I continued the drive toward Concord. <<|needle|>>This is lovely countryside.Now, you've just gotta love a

like 500 acres!One of the destinations in the park is this planetarium. <<|needle|>>Sadly, it was closed.<image>The Ella Sharp Museum of Art and History was open, however, and for a mere $5 I was able to stroll through about five small galleries. <<|needle|>>They had a very interesting \"wildlife\" exhibit, featuring primarily birds donated from a local collector. <<|needle|>>These were stuffed birds as well as woodcarvings and bronze casts. <<|needle|>>The artistry was amazing.I also greatly enjoyed the exhibits about the local history. <<|needle|>>This is where I learned of all the various

helping me out!\nPosted by Ellen Rathbone at 11:11 AMThe Thai Prime Minister has extended the country’s state of emergency amid the Covid-19 outbreak. <<|needle|>>This is more an attempt to consolidate power, rather than a move to buttress the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nPrime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha’s decision to extend the state of emergency in Thailand to the end of May is ultimately not meant so much to reinforce the country’s fight against a possible second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic; rather, it is an attempt to consolidate political power in the face of major challenges, notably social unrest ignited by the economic impact of the virus.\n\nOn the day that the extension was announced on 28 April, Thailand had reported only seven newly confirmed cases of the virus and two deaths. <<|needle|>>Similarly, 39 out of the country’s 77 provinces had still not reported a single case of Covid-19. <<|needle|>>The government did ease some restrictions, which allowed social and economic activities such as exercise and sports in open parks, as well as the opening of restaurants and hair salons. <<|needle|>>But the night curfew and restrictions on crowded gatherings remain in place.\n\nNational Security Council secretary-general General Somsak Rungsita said that the state of emergency had been extended not only for public health reasons but also with an eye on security matters. <<|needle|>> Its authorising the government to maintain a curfew and control the movement of the people and the free flow of information should be seen in this light.\n\nThe 2005 Royal Decree on the Administration of Emergency Situations authorises Prime Minister Prayut to centralise many government operations under the newly-created Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration. <<|needle|>>The centre is manned by civil servants of relevant ministries and security officials. <<|needle|>>Under the law, Prayut overruled the power of politicians serving as cabinet members and provincial governors. <<|needle|>>He authorised the commander-in-chief of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, General Pornpipat Benyasri, to oversee security matters during the emergency. <<|needle|>>The commander exercised his authority on 1 May, instructing soldiers and police to set up checkpoints and patrols to enforce the night curfew.\n\nAs a vaccination against Covid-19 will not be available anytime soon, social distancing is the only viable means of dealing with the outbreak. <<|needle|>>But this has had a negative impact on the economy and caused frustration in society, as much economic activity has ceased and many people have no work. <<|needle|>>In the past month, dramatic protests have occurred several times at the Ministry of Finance. <<|needle|>>A large number of people who have suffered from the shutdown of the economy appeared to have been left out of the government’s 5,000 baht cash handout scheme. <<|needle|>>A 58-year-old woman received cash relief only after she had poisoned herself at the ministry in protest over the long and complicated process of applying for inclusion in the scheme.\n\nMore dramatically, a 19-year-old mother committed suicide after posting online a pencil sketch that she had drawn of Prime Minister Prayut. <<|needle|>>She complained of the hardship that she faced under the “heartless” leader’s mismanagement. <<|needle|>>She had no money to buy milk to feed her child after losing her job as a security guard during the lockdown. <<|needle|>>Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said the suicide was political, as former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra joined a number of politicians to host a funeral for the young woman. <<|needle|>>A few dozen other people also reportedly took their own lives to escape from the economic hardship stemming from the crisis.\n\nThe social frustration is of concern to the government. <<|needle|>>Many students who had been politically active before the outbreak are calling for action. <<|needle|>>Using the #MobFromHome social media hashtag as they remained shut in in their homes, they demonstrated against what they perceived to be the government’s ineffective response to Covid-19 and inadequate relief scheme. <<|needle|>>They called for the end of the state of emergency and demanded that the government rely not on special powers but rather on laws such as the 2015 Communicable Disease Act to control the outbreak.\n\nTheir demands are reasonable, as the virus situation has improved enough. <<|needle|>>The students also expressed their concern that the government was abusing the emergency decree for political purposes by restricting media freedom and public assemblies. <<|needle|>>Many of them expressed their intention to resume actual, rather than merely virtual, protests against government after the end of the state of emergency.\n\nThe social frustration is of concern to the government. <<|needle|>>Many students who had been politically active before the outbreak are calling for action.\n\nPrayut’s attempt to consolidate powers come at a time when there is some ruction in the ruling coalition and the opposition. <<|needle|>>The country’s parliamentary opposition is in a weakened position after the loss of some MPs to the government camp after the dissolution of the popular Future Forward Party. <<|needle|>>But internal rifts within the ruling coalition’s main Phalang Pracharat Party have become more apparent. <<|needle|>>Factions in the party have moved to sack Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana from the position of party chief. <<|needle|>>This paved the way for Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, a Prayut ally and chief party strategist, to assume the leadership of Phalang Pracharat. <<|needle|>>Uttama, a technocrat, has been accused of being too weak to control the politicians in the fractious party. <<|needle|>>He is an ally of Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak and Energy Minister Sothirat Sontijirawong. <<|needle|>>The former is the country’s economic tsar, while the latter is the secretary general of the party. <<|needle|>>Factions in the party have also questioned whether the trio has the skills to handle the economic contraction resulting from the virus. <<|needle|>>They have called for Prayut to carry out a reshuffle of his cabinet.\n\nWhile Prayut might be able to use the outbreak as a legitimate reason to extend his special powers and to keep the administration and bureaucracy under his control, the ex-general needs to realise that efficiency and effectiveness, rather than consolidating political power, will alleviate the suffering of Thais from the economic hardship in the aftermath of Covid-19.What if General Prayut Resigns?America’s Soft Power in Vietnam: From Statecraft to Street RapRallying Team Thailand in the Fight against Covid-19The past year has seen some serious tire kicking over a bottle of 50-year-old single malt Scotch safely locked in a wooden cabinet at a Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation store in Halifax, but so far the rare bottle remains up for grabs.\n\nThis week, I checked with the

however. <<|needle|>>“I am afraid that is not possible. <<|needle|>>We only have one bottle, which has been in the store for the last year.”\n\nThe Halifax store has other Bowmore selections, including a bottle for $59 of 12-year-old, which is one way to get a sample of the 50-year-old: Buy now and put away for 38 years.\n\n“We have a great selection of single malts at the Port,” Cyr adds.\n\nThe Port store on Clyde Street (formerly the Port of Wines) is the new flagship store of the NSLC.\n\nThe $30,999 price for a bottle of Bowmore whisky is a sticker shock for many customers at the Port store who frequently then take selfies with the bottle, says store customer experience manager Dave Pierowa.\n\nInterestingly, the bottle is $5,000 cheaper than an identical bottle in Toronto, so a canny shopper there might want to hop a plane to Halifax and save a few dollars.\n\n“In 2013, only 200 bottles of this exquisite single malt remained and they have been released every year, 50 at a time, until now,” says a news release from the Ontario liquor corporation.\n\n“Distilled in 1961, this was aged for 50 years in two ex-bourbon hogshead casks. <<|needle|>>These smaller casks allowed more of the whisky to have direct contact with the wood, introducing richer influence on the final whisky.“This amazing collector’s item will have aromas and flavours of almonds, coconuts, tree oil, and citrus and tropical fruit with a gentle underlying smoke.”\n\nPierowa tells The Macdonald Notebook that he puts on an annual Scotch seminar for Port customers, and the last event was held in January. <<|needle|>>There is a single malt club that meets monthly at the Press Gang restaurant.\n\nIf the half-century-old bottle of Bowmore is out of your range — it is certainly beyond mine — there are other somewhat cheaper bottles that still will stretch a wallet.\n\nOther bottles in the locked wooden case include:Gabby, at Port store in Halifax\n\nAt the Port, affable

an important role in housing and infrastructure investment, and in the face of increasing pressure on the public budget, innovative financial instruments could leverage public funding and draw investments from the private sector, according to European Commission vice president Jyrki Katainen.\n\nKatainen, a former Prime Minister of Finland, leads the Jobs, Growth, Investment & Competitiveness project team at the European Commission, and he was speaking at the 85th Euroconstruct Conference in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nHe said that the commission had clear political guidelines that focused on 10 priority areas.\n\n“Many of them matter for construction,” he said. <<|needle|>>“In particular, stimulating investment is a major priority for the EU.”\n\nHe said, “EU support alone would, of course, not be sufficient to close investment gaps in all areas. <<|needle|>>We need to mobilise the private investor. <<|needle|>>Without private engagement and money, we cannot achieve our objectives, and we must achieve a much higher leverage of public funds through wider use of financial instruments.”Katainen, “The construction sector is at the very core of the modernisation of the European economy”\n\nHe explained that the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI) addressed these investment deficits in the EU, using the EU budget in projects which were strategically important for the EU.\n\nThe investment fund has mobilised €290 billion in investments to date, according to Katainen, who said it was mostly private capital, out of a target of raising €500 billion by 2020. <<|needle|>>He added that almost 400 projects across Europe had been approved so far.\n\nHe said, “For the next budgetary period, which is supposed to start from the beginning of 2021, we propose to continue and scale up this kind of support in a single InvestEU fund.\n\nKatainen told the conference that financing was not the only issue which had relevance for the construction sector, saying, “We also need to look at the business environment – at European level and also internationally.\n\n“Two megatrends in the world economy in the coming years are artificial intelligence (AI) and the circular economy, and they both need to be looked at through the regulatory angles.”\n\nHe said that if Europe wanted to promote these two areas, regulatory changes needed to be considered to let them flourish in Europe.\n\nHe also mentioned smart buildings, and said that these factors were the reason that it could be expected that the construction sector should be one of the drivers in the years to come.\n\nAfter the conference, Katainen talked more about artificial intelligence, saying, “There are two angles. <<|needle|>>The first one is to improve the smartness of buildings by using AI.”<image>Katainen told the conference, “There is an infrastructure investment need because AI will reshape the way we live in cities”\n\nThe second point, he said, was that, especially in urban areas, changes were coming about because cities used different ways of organising, for example, public transport and other public services.\n\n“So there is an infrastructure investment need because AI will reshape the way we live in cities.”\n\nOn the topic of investment by manufacturers, he said there was no one way of achieving this because Europe was so diverse.\n\n“There are more drivers in the construction sector now than was the case, let’s say 10 or 15 years ago.\n\n“For instance, AI and everything that it enables for changing the physical environment in cities is one driver. <<|needle|>>Second, there is growing consumer demand for cleaner, low-carbon solutions on constructions.”\n\nHe said that the development of smart mobility, for instance, was very different between the various regions and countries, but that this was another driver.\n\n“There are different kinds of drivers which are not happening at the same time to the same extent everywhere.The conference heard that economic growth was expected to remain solid\n\n“If 20 years ago there was a need for housing and a need for roads, now the drivers are more diverse.”\n\nHe said, “What the EU can do in this respect is to support innovations in the construction sector. <<|needle|>>It’s very important in order to achieve, for instance, climate targets and to improve productivity at the same time.\n\n“The second thing is to provide financing to renew the existing building stocks to become more energy efficient, and this can happen everywhere – there is a need for this everywhere.”\n\nThe Euroconstruct conference also heard from Anni Sinnemäki, Helsinki’s deputy mayor for urban environment, who said that growth, as was being seen in the city, was a positive thing.Sinnemäki, “We have to be faster”\n\nA strategic master plan was formulated two years ago, with 5,000 homes to be built each year.\n\n“Helsinki is different from rest of the country – there is minus growth in rest of country,” said Sinnemäki.\n\nShe added that construction offered challenges, for both newbuild and refurbishment. <<|needle|>>She said refurbishment was more complex and that it had to be considered whether the incentives were in the right place, and whether they should be stricter.\n\nThe main reason for the Euroconstruct conference was to look at the performance of the European construction market.\n\nA research and consulting group, Euroconstruct was founded in 1975, and offers analysis of and forecasting for construction market trends in Europe. <<|needle|>>It has members representing 19 countries around Europe. <<|needle|>>Its 85th conference was hosted by its Finnish member – Forecon – and was held at the Finlandia Hall in the Finnish capital.\n\nThe conference heard that European construction was growing well on the back of low interest rates, good economic growth and “pent-up needs”.\n\nForecon said that economic growth was expected to remain solid, unemployment would decrease, exports would grow, interest rates would remain low and the confidence of consumers, and business and industry in the future was high.\n\nAs a result of this, tax revenue will increase, it said, allowing, for example, increasing investment in public construction, transport networks and other infrastructure. <<|needle|>>It added that urbanisation, immigration and internal migration, and ageing of the population were other important factors from the viewpoint of construction.\n\nThe Euroconstruct forecast at June 2018, suggested that European construction would grow 2.7% this year. <<|needle|>>It said the pace would slow down from last year’s 3.9%.\n\nGrowth will continue in 2019 and 2020, but at a slower rate, it said, adding that construction would “no longer be the European engine of growth”.\n\nIt pointed out that growth in European construction was broad-based and was seen in all main sectors – residential, non-residential and civil engineering, both new construction and renovation.\n\nDespite growth, the volume of construction is below the 2007 level, said Euroconstruct.\n\n“European construction has seen large fluctuations in the last 10 years,” it said. <<|needle|>>“After the financial crisis, construction contracted for five years and turned to growth in 2014.\n\n“This is the fifth consecutive year of growth. <<|needle|>>As growth is expected to continue also in 2019 and 2020, the sector is in for a seven-year growth streak.”Euroconstruct, “The volume of construction can be said to reach the 2007 level this year”\n\nIt said, however, that the rise from the 2013 low had been slow, and the volume of construction in the Euroconstruct area would still be 14% lower than in 2007.\n\n“Considering the unhealthily high construction volumes of a few European countries before the financial crisis and the very powerful collapse, the volume of construction can be said to reach the 2007 level this year,” it said.\n\n“A similar phenomenon has occurred in the US – a multi-year collapse followed by a long period of growth. <<|needle|>>There construction turned to growth in 2011 and will reach the pre-financial crisis record level of 2006 after a few years.”\n\nThe Euroconstruct forecast said that 2018 and the next two years would see the fastest construction growth in Hungary, Poland, Ireland and Portugal. <<|needle|>>It is predicting nearly 12% a year growth in Hungary, and 7 to 8% in the other countries.\n\nIt felt that growth would stop in the next few years in Finland, Germany and Sweden.Sweden and Finland were responsible for the Nordic slowdown, according to the Euroconstruct Conference\n\nIt said that Sweden and Finland were responsible for the Nordic slowdown. <<|needle|>>In 2019 and 2020 the average growth was predicted to be somewhat negative in Finland and in Sweden, but would remain positive in Norway and in Denmark.\n\nThe next Euroconstruct Conference will be held in Paris in November 2018, hosted by French member BIPE.Recent mornings saw overcast skies, cold winds and very little sunshine. <<|needle|>>Such mornings are not ideal for a visit to the Pennine hills with a camera itching to click. <<|needle|>>I pencilled in Wednesday for an early start and then watched as the forecasts did their best to thwart the plan.\nThere was a thirty minute drive before the first stone walls above Garstang where waders, wagtails and pipits wait for townies to slow, or stop and stare. <<|needle|>>they quickly drive on, not knowing the names of common British birds while clueless as to the dramas that unfold behind them.\nIn April and throughout May begins a potent mix of territorial song and single-minded ownership of a stretch of wall, fence, hedgerow and a patch of ground. <<|needle|>> By late May and into June begins the frantic warnings to vulnerable young and the loud scolding of intruders - man, beast or bird.<image>Oystercatcher\nIt would be interesting to see how birds react to a car and wound down window following eight weeks when Joe Public was locked out from their heritage. <<|needle|>>While the shutdown continued gamekeepers were given a free pass for the “essential work” of supplying Red Grouse for the shooting season of 12th August.\n\nDuring this time the RSPB were flooded with reports of birds of prey being killed in the uplands - a pure coincidence perhaps?  The Guardian.Red Grouse\nFor those who wish to continue reading, I will post the same link at the bottom of this page together with a link to Raptor Rescue with the question - \"Why has grouse shooting not been banned for this year?\"\nBut now back to the job in hand and a favourite stretch of road where the farmer had been busy catching moles.Moles\nI saw upland waders in their regular spots - Lapwing, Redshank, Curlew, Snipe and Oystercatcher but probably less Oystercatchers and Lapwings than in recent years. <<|needle|>>2020 has been an exceptionally dry spring, one that has not been beneficial to birds that probe wet areas for food. <<|needle|>>On the other hand there seemed good numbers of Snipe this morning, and decent counts of both Curlew and Redshank, three species that favour soft ground. <<|needle|>> And, I was surprised to see one or two roadside puddles perhaps as a result of a drop or two of heavier rain on Tuesday.Snipe\nThere was a Redshank that survived a winter or two despite the handicap of sheep wool entwined around each ankle.<image>Pied Wagtail\nI saw plenty of Meadow Pipits, not too many Pied Wagtails, but 20 or more Grey Wagtails along the various watercourses up here. <<|needle|>>Both Meadow Pipits and Pied Wagtails have yet to show many youngsters, but the early breeding Grey wags have had a good year. <<|needle|>>This was a dry spring and zero disturbance from the annual day trippers who like to splash sticks and stones into the many streams.Grey Wagtail\nThe streams held a couple of pairs of Common Sandpiper, a single Grey Heron and a small colony of 30 or more Sand Martins in the low riverbank banks of Cam Brow. <<|needle|>>Unfortunately this is another spot favoured by the sticks and stones brigade of picnicking tourists, now with no work but beginning to return to Bowland on sunny days.\nIt’s difficult not to hear Cuckoos but virtually impossible to see them up here in Bowland. <<|needle|>>I guess I heard six male Cuckoos this morning, one or two fairly close, but saw not a one. <<|needle|>>Maybe this is a sign that the fortunes of the Common Cuckoo are on the up?\nAt Marshaw the House Martin colony at Tower Lodge was frantic with birds rushing in and out of the eaves and eager to make up for lost time of their late arrival. <<|needle|>>Hard to say how many with the eaves in near darkness but six or eight nests looked likely.\nOther birds seen but not photographed today included 6 Blackcap, 2 Redstart, 3 Spotted Flycatcher, 3 Pied Flycatcher, 2 Lesser Redpoll,  8/10 Willow Warbler, 4 Mistle Thrush and piles of Blackbirds. <<|needle|>> Those links below.\nRSPB flooded with reports of birds of prey being killed.\nRaptor Politics.\nMore soon. <<|needle|>>Stay Tuned.The last third of our trip around Malaysia was spent in the Malaysian part of Borneo. <<|needle|>>The plan was simple – get into the jungle and experience the wonderful nature (without sacrificing too much comfort and getting too many mosquito bites). <<|needle|>>Unfortunately we knew very little of Borneo and our guide book wasn’t helping enough. <<|needle|>>Anyhow, we flew from Langkawi to Kuching, main city of the Sarawak region of Borneo, via Kuala Lumpur. <<|needle|>>We were quite stressed out as we had booked flights without much time in between and AirAsia, our airline, didn’t offer any help, they just told us that we should have taken other flights.\n\nWe made it through, but in the process I happened to be a victim of the well known “glass-bottle-in-the-bag-with-smelly-contents-break-in-luggage-handling”. <<|needle|>>It was not any bottle, it was a bottle of Langkawian herbal oil that doesn’t smell good but smells a lot. <<|needle|>>My bag could be noticed from several meters away and the check-in lady refused to take it without further sealing – so I got it completely wrapped up in plastics. <<|needle|>>The damage from this chemical catastrophy was not too bad after all though, but one of my books will forever have a scent of Langkawi as well as brown pages instead of white. <<|needle|>>‘Nuff said.\n\nAnyway, Kuching was not much of a city. <<|needle|>>We had to look for hours after decent restaurants and although the city claimed to be tourist oriented it seemed to have forgotten us tourists in the middle of January. <<|needle|>>We lived on a quite fancy hotel, the Harbourview Inn, but where not overly impressed although the standards were good. <<|needle|>>We ate at an italian restaurant at a nearby luxury hotel and payed as much as any normal Hong Kong restaurant would charge us, which was nice. <<|needle|>>We didn’t want to waste too much time in Kuching though, so after much decision anxiety we ordered a two-day trip into the jungle, to Lemanak.Basically, we were picked up at the hotel by a nice and talkative guide, which first took us to an orangutang center. <<|needle|>>We saw very few orangutangs – it started raining when they started arrive and we made a pitiful escape without any decent photos to show of the amazing primates (their way of getting through the jungle in the tree tops is just awesome). <<|needle|>>We then continued to a river and switched to long, narrow river boats to get to our destination, the Iban village of Lemanak.We had expected really primitive conditions, headhunter warriors and similar stuff, but soon enough we understood the truth were a bit different. <<|needle|>>The village was receiving tourists each day and had a special longhouse for them with decent standards, even showers and kitchen. <<|needle|>>The main long house was used for selling handicraft, although most of it wasn’t made by the villagers – it was imported and sold for higher prices than in Kuching. <<|needle|>>They had a phone, and their houses was decorated as any normal home in the area. <<|needle|>>Even though all this took away some of the feeling it was still special – the villagers were mostly old people with strange tatoos drinking rice wine (and offering us). <<|needle|>>They showed us traditional dances and ended up partying with us thanks to a couple of bottles of local rice wine. <<|needle|>>The next morning we were shown a cock fight, we tried blow pipe (surprisingly easy to use!) and made a jungle walk to see all the medicinal plants and traps that the people used. <<|needle|>>All in all, it was a nice experience with a really nice guide!\n\nAfter the trip to Lemanak, we started to look over our budget. <<|needle|>>It was not looking good, so we chose to try and do the rest of the trip on our own with budget alternatives (a decision we later didn’t follow at all). <<|needle|>>So we took a night bus across Sarawak to the town of Miri, portal to the great Mulu National Park with it’s famous jungle and caves. <<|needle|>>The bus ride was not just any bus ride, it was a 14 hour bus ride in total darkness and with winter climate inside due to fierce air conditioning. <<|needle|>>The only light came from the police road blocks that we encountered (and every time a serious police officer entered the bus and looked closely at our pass ports). <<|needle|>>It was a bit hard to sleep…\n\nAfter the grueling night we took a Fokker 50 from Miri to Mulu and ended up in a house that, according to the sign, was an airport. <<|needle|>>You have to understand that Mulu National Park has two hotels, two roads and nothing more. <<|needle|>>It is apparently not possible to drive to Mulu from anywhere (but I wonder how they got their cars there…). <<|needle|>>The only way is flying (no, there is another way… read below…). <<|needle|>>We had heard that Mulu had a great and cheap luxury resort, Royal Mulu, so we jumped on their van from the “airport” and ended up in an amazin resort (of which I have no pictures!). <<|needle|>>We payed around 10-12 Euros per night and person for 4-star standards. <<|needle|>>As time went on though, we realized where the resort got their income – expensive food and insultingly expensive arranged tours.We decided to skip the hotel tours and walked to the park office, where they offer the same tours as the resort, but for a tenth or less of the cost. <<|needle|>>So we went. <<|needle|>>And we saw amazing caves and jungles. <<|needle|>>I can’t make justice to the park in text, and probably not in the photos either. <<|needle|>>You should just go there, but I can throw some facts at you: Deer Cave, the biggest cave passage in the world (supposedly big enough to containt St Peters Cathedral in Rome) with 3 million bats that flies out every evening; Clearwater Cave, 108 km long with an underground river all the way; Cave of the Winds with strong winds going through, a fantastic hole right up to the sky and the “King’s Chamber” made of stalagmites.So, where exactly did this part of the trip get so disappointing? Actually, right here. <<|needle|>>After going through the caves we had to start thinking about leaving, we had a plan to catch in Singapore (to HK) two days later. <<|needle|>>Unfortunately we hadn’t booked the flights to get from Mulu to Singapore via Miri. <<|needle|>>And here the trouble began – the Mulu->Miri flight was cancelled and then fully booked. <<|needle|>>The earliest flight from Mulu would only connect to one flight from Miri, which was fully booked (due to the Chinese New Year). <<|needle|>>We just realized we had a quite expensive ticket for a Singapore-HK flight which we wouldn’t get to and suddenly and unwillingly we had to extend our budget. <<|needle|>>How did we solve it? Listen to this:We went up at 2 AM in the morning of the 27th January. <<|needle|>>At 3 AM we left with a chartered longboat down the river in complete darkness (an extremely expensive boat, by the way). <<|needle|>>At 5 AM we arrived at the first hint of civilisation, the stop for the regular river boat service. <<|needle|>>We switched boat, waited for a long time and then started our next part of the trip down river. <<|needle|>>At 10 AM (!) we arrived at the first town, were we switched to the next boat. <<|needle|>>At 12 AM we finally arrived at the mouth of the river, and we switched to taxi to Miri. <<|needle|>>Why? To buy an airplane ticket we had called about last night from Brunei to Singapore. <<|needle|>>Unfortunately the ticket we wanted couldn’t be bought there but they had it at the Brunei Airport for double the price. <<|needle|>>So, now we called a taxi to go to Brunei, were we arrived after much trouble in the border control at 5 PM. <<|needle|>>The flight left at 7 PM to Singapore, and at 9 PM we went to “bed” in a chair in Pacific Coffee at the Changi Aiport, Singapore. <<|needle|>>The flight from Singapore left at 7 AM and finally we arrived in HK at 11 AM. <<|needle|>>The whole effort, not including the Singapore-HK flight, costed us around 300-350 Euro, probably more than all previous travel costs combined. <<|needle|>>So children, learn this – book your flights home well in advance when you go traveling!\n\n3 thoughts on “Borneo, land of clouds”There are loads of audiobooks under ten hours, so for this list, the last in a series of short audiobooks broken down by length, I picked ten of my very favorite audiobooks (of any length). <<|needle|>>These are books that I loved so much on audio, it’s hard for me to imagine reading them any other way. <<|needle|>>The narration adds something specific to the experience of reading each of these books.\n\nReady? We’ve got memoir, YA historical fiction, essays, two contemporary novels, a murder mystery with a side of magic, and dystopian fiction. <<|needle|>>It’s a little bit of everything. <<|needle|>>Whether you’re looking for a heavy listen or a funny one, something to uplift you or something to challenge you, hopefully one of these audiobooks under ten hours will hit the spot.<image>This is one of those singular books that feels like an unbelievable gift; the depth with which Laymon is willing to reveal himself through his words is stunning. <<|needle|>>It’s a memoir about being a Black son and living in a Black body, about the physical and emotional weight of trauma, secrets, and complex relationships. <<|needle|>>The memoir is built around Laymon’s relationship with his mother, but it spirals outward from there, as he explores art, masculinity, history, and family. <<|needle|>>Laymon’s writing is incandescent; every other sentence made me gasp out loud or want to cry. <<|needle|>>Listening to Laymon read this book himself is something sacred: a painful and revelatory experience.In these seven incredible essays, Cathy Park Hong delves into the complexities of Asian American experiences and the ways that Asian American identities are so often ignored/simplified/fetishized/lumped together when talking about race. <<|needle|>>Writing both from her own life as a poet and the daughter of Korean immigrants, as well as exploring art, language, friendship, history, and writing, these essays are illuminating and rigorous. <<|needle|>>Hong’s narration is crisp and precise; even though she’s reading essays, you can tell that she’s a poet. <<|needle|>>This is an absolutely vital contribution to the ongoing conversation about race in America.In a series of essays exploring her own experiences with schizophrenia, Wang takes readers on a journey through the history, treatment, and societal myths and misconceptions of mental illness. <<|needle|>>She writes with refreshing directness about her own life, and looks at chronic illness and schizophrenia specifically from so many angles and perspectives. <<|needle|>>This short book feels exhaustive—not because Wang says all there is to say on the matter, obviously, but because she delves so deeply into it. <<|needle|>>Her narration is quiet, almost mesmerizing, mirroring the thoughtfulness and intention behind her words.\n\nMake It Scream, Make It BurnThere’s a searching, meandering quality to Jamison’s voice as she narrates these essays, which matches the essays themselves. <<|needle|>>Whether they focus on the relationship between artists and their subjects, her experiences with (step)motherhood, or the various ways loneliness manifests in herself and others, there’s a thread of uncertainty and curiosity running through them all. <<|needle|>>These essays, both the personal ones and those that explore other subjects, are full of keen observations and insights, but they don’t offer any kind of absolute truth or moral judgement. <<|needle|>>Jamison is open to all the contradictions that exist in the world, and inviters readers to wonder, delight, and fume over them with her.Ivy is a PI just trying to live her life. <<|needle|>>She certainly doesn’t want anything to do with magic. <<|needle|>>Her estranged sister Tabitha is the magical one; having gone off to magic school as a teenager, she’s now a professor there. <<|needle|>>When a staff member at the school is murdered, Ivy arrives to work the case. <<|needle|>>While there, she’s forced to confront all the emotions she’s long kept buried, including her complex feelings about her sister and their shared grief over the loss of their mother. <<|needle|>>Xe Sands is absolutely incredible here; her voicing of the lonely, closed-off, work-focused Ivy is pitch-perfect. <<|needle|>>She does a great job with all the other character voices, but the voice she creates for Ivy is so distinct that I can still hear it in my head weeks later.\n\nTomorrow Will Be DifferentThis memoir combines McBride’s personal and professional journeys in a way that’s fresh and engaging. <<|needle|>>She tells intimate stories about coming out as trans, and falling in love with and then losing her husband to cancer, as well as recounting the inspiring trajectory of her career in politics and as a transgender activist. <<|needle|>>Her narration captures her passion for her work, the pain of being a young closeted trans woman, and all the elation, frustration, anger, heartbreak, and joy she’s experienced as an activist and human being.This is an incredibly internal book—it takes place over the course of one weekend (with flashbacks) and it’s full of long, emotional passages that take place inside the protagonist’s head. <<|needle|>>It takes a talented narrator to bring this kind of beautiful writing to life, and Kevin R. <<|needle|>>Free does it perfectly. <<|needle|>>Wallace is a Black gay grad student getting his PhD at a small university in the Midwest. <<|needle|>>He’s one of the few people of color in his program and he has a mostly white group of friends. <<|needle|>>When the book opens, his father has just died, something he hasn’t told anyone in his life. <<|needle|>>This is a heavy novel, steeped in loneliness. <<|needle|>>Taylor is a magician with words, weaving scenes and moments that are painfully ordinary and relatable, and Kevin R. <<|needle|>>Free takes those moments and makes sure you feel them down to your bones.Nancy Wu’s narration is part cheeky satire, part fever dream, which is also a perfect description of this novel. <<|needle|>>Candace is a vaguely unhappy millennial working in a New York office when an apocalyptic fever descends on the city. <<|needle|>>The novel moves swiftly from a sharp look at millennial life in the early 2000s to a post-apocalyptic road trip story, as Candace wanders through, and eventually leaves, a dying New York. <<|needle|>>Nancy Wu is one of my favorite narrators, and she’s at her best here.\n\nMusic from Another World<image>Set against the backdrop of gay activism in the 1970s, this is an uplifting YA novel about friendship, queer identity, and finding your people. <<|needle|>>Tammy is a closeted lesbian living in Orange County with her conservative religious family, who are big supporters of Anita Bryant and heavily involved in her anti-gay campaigns. <<|needle|>>Sharon is a teenager in San Francisco just discovering her love of punk music, and helping her brother hide his sexuality from their Catholic mother. <<|needle|>>When the two girls are assigned as penpals for a summer project, they form a connection that changes both their lives. <<|needle|>>The story is told entirely through diary entries and letters;

(1896), is a piece of stained glass in which a white rose representing Finland rises over Lake Keitele.He returned to this landscape even as he studied, during the 1880s, at the Academie Julien and atelier of Fernand Cormon in Paris, where he fell in with a circle of Nordic painters. <<|needle|>>Though he produced pleasant scenes of bars and boulevards, these hardly distracted him. <<|needle|>>‘On account of my homesickness in so-called great civilised countries – Germany, France, England, and Italy – I have not been able to depict their landscapes or draw a single line to visualise the life of their people. <<|needle|>>I could not even if I sometimes wanted to,’ he later remarked. <<|needle|>>Instead, each summer he returned to Finland, where he painted the sunset from the shores of Lake Jamajärvi.\n\nThen known as Axel Gallen, he quickly made a name for himself with these paintings, debuting at the Salon des Artistes in 1886 and winning a medal at the Exposition Universelle in 1889. <<|needle|>>By 1890, he had married and spent his honeymoon in East Karelia, near the border, where he portrayed his rural neighbours – seemingly as representatives of an authentic Finnish people. <<|needle|>>Just a few generations earlier, they had shared their spoken folklore with the philologist Elias Lönnrot, to be compiled in his epic Kalevala (1835), a touchstone for Finnish identity.Soon after this encounter, Gallen-Kallela, who had studied Finnish traditional log architecture, sought out a peninsula at Ruovesi to build Kalela, his family homestead and studio. <<|needle|>>A general interest in landscape evolved into a more personal portrayal of his own private dwelling – many works after this time are vistas from his porch – occasionally featuring him and his family rowing or skiing outside.\n\nThe exhibition gives ample space to lesser-known strands of Gallen-Kallela’s work, such as his mixed media designs, among them stylised and verdant murals showing the seasons of life for a mausoleum. <<|needle|>>Flame, an almost abstract design, is here seen on a wall-hanging, one of several furnishings and furniture produced for the Finnish Pavilion at the Exposition Universelle in 1900. <<|needle|>>Elsewhere, small scale engravings, made in wake of his young daughter’s death in 1895, explore darker themes. <<|needle|>>Inspiration, a particularly devastating work from 1896, shows Gallen-Kallela huddled by the hearth in the throes of grief.A suite of rooms dedicated to Gallen-Kallela’s interest in mythology, spirituality and symbolism are particularly striking in a relatively pokey gallery space. <<|needle|>>Esoteric works such as River of the Dead (1893), in which a river flows through infinite space, reflect the artist’s participation in seances and study of astronomy. <<|needle|>>Ad Astra (1907), an ambiguous painting in an intricate gold frame, depicts a young woman with arms outstretched and visible stigmata. <<|needle|>>It is presented in the manner of an altarpiece in an otherwise darkened, chapel-like room.\n\nDespite tackling a great range of subject matter, Gallen-Kallela is still regarded primarily as a landscape painter. <<|needle|>>On this occasion, The Aino Triptych returns to Paris where it was painted in the 1880s. <<|needle|>>It was his first subject from the Kalevala, a book he read in secret as a child. <<|needle|>>The work stages Finnish legend within the country’s gently majestic landscape and, adding a personal touch, the character of Aino is modelled for by his wife. <<|needle|>>Combining the mythic with the intimate and everyday, Gallen-Kallela produced a contemporary cultural heritage for Finland. <<|needle|>>Fighting on the side of the ‘Whites’ alongside his son Jorma in the Civil War in 1918, he would live to see his country become a sovereign nation.\n\n‘Gallen-Kallela: Myths and Nature’ is at the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris, until 25 July.Finnish lines – paintings from the land of a thousand lakesJussi Kivi represented the country at the Venice Biennale in 2009, before retreating from the limelight. <<|needle|>>Now he’s back with a book from Helsinki’s edgelands<image>OK, St. <<|needle|>>Peter's Basilica and Square are soooo big and amazing that we need a couple of blogs. <<|needle|>>It's much easier and quicker to get into than the Vatican Museum, which is where the Sistine Chapel is. <<|needle|>>How bad is the VM lineup? At 1000h, it stretched along the Vatican walls pretty much the whole kilometre to the Piazza San Pietro! In addition to the Pope-mobile, the whole Vatican is guarded by the Swiss Guards with their very sharp and pointy pikes, not to mention their court jester outfits.Jacob in the middle of the Piazza, me balancing on top of a concrete pylon in front of the huge obelisk in the centre of the round piazza. <<|needle|>>The piazza is surround by over a hundred columns, each adorned with prophets and saints. <<|needle|>>The Pope blesses the masses on Sundays and Wednesdays, so don't expect to get anywhere near those days!This blog, we'll focus on the dome created by, who else, Michelangelo. <<|needle|>>It was inspired by the amazing Pantheon dome (see future blog). <<|needle|>>The scale of things in the Basilica is really, really mind-boggling. <<|needle|>>These photos are from the base of the dome looking down into the church to the smaller side naves, each of which are bigger than all but the biggest cathedrals in the world! Zach will tell you how what and how big those letters you see are in the next blog - give it a good guess in the meantime!Again at the base of the dome itself. <<|needle|>>It's all mosaic tiles on the whole dome!<image>From the base of the dome, it's another 300+ steps to the top. <<|needle|>>We're not holding the camera at an angle on the left - the interior of the dome is on our right and it gets really slanted and tricky to walk inside! Once at the top, you get a pretty amazing view of all of Rome, including the Piazza below where the people are just itty-bitty-specks.\nPosted by Unknown at 09:22How Does A Bong Work?A Russian excavation shows that tribal leaders of the Iranian-Eurasian Skith tribe used to smoke with golden bongs 2,400 years ago. <<|needle|>>This corresponds to the earliest discovery of ancient bong use. <<|needle|>>Before the excavation of the Scythian bong, the earliest known bong was found in a cave in Ethiopia, between 1100 and 1400 AD. <<|needle|>>Eleven bongs were found in the cave, many of which extended underground to form a cooling system. <<|needle|>>The pipes and bottles used for these bongs were made from animal horns and original pottery.\n\nWritten records of bong use come from Central Asia in the 16th century. <<|needle|>>Thus, it is theorized that smoking guns were introduced during the Ming Dynasty in China and spread through the Silk Road. <<|needle|>>It is worth mentioning that China's regent, Empress Dowager Cixi, was even found buried with her three precious bongs during the Qing Dynasty.\n\nNow bongs look more complicated than simple bamboo tubes, but their basic operating principles are similar. <<|needle|>>But whether you're an avid smoker or new to the 420 worlds, chances are you're wondering, how exactly do bongs work? Why does using it excite you so much? The accessories that match the bong, what are their real functions?\n\nHow does a bong work?\n\nLet's take a look at how the bongs work:1. <<|needle|>>Light the precious marijuana in the pipe bowl\n\nWhen your precious marijuana in the pipe bowl is lit, you need to suck the air from the bong. <<|needle|>>The air produced by the ignited marijuana will be carried into the airway under the bong as you suck it, and then into the smoking chamber. <<|needle|>>But how much smoke gets into the smoke chamber depends on how hard you draw it. <<|needle|>>However, that the novice is best to extract . <<|needle|>>Because this helps the smoke get through the filter well and makes you less prone to choking on the smoke.There are many kinds of filters, among which down stem is also one of the simplest filters. <<|needle|>>In general, the joint of the bong will be equipped with a plunger, and the bottom of the bong will be filled with an appropriate amount of water. <<|needle|>>The height of the water should be just below the plunger. <<|needle|>>After the smoke comes into contact with the water through the smoke chamber, it will have a cooling effect. <<|needle|>>It also produces small air bubbles that allow the smoke to come into contact with the water over a larger area, resulting in more cooling.In addition to the plunger, many bongs have a built-in or external filter. <<|needle|>>The shape of the filter is designed to be different, and the bubbles generated are also in a variety of strange states. <<|needle|>>But the basic effect is to let the smoke come into contact with moisture in a larger area and be cooled.\n\nBut after the smoke has been filtered by the plunger and the built-in filter, the hot smoke is generally cooled twice as much as it was when it was first ignited. <<|needle|>>If you want, you can filter several more layers to get the best filtering effect for the smoke.If you want some extra experience, choose some bongs with ice forks. <<|needle|>>Ice fork refers to designing several concave designs in the pipe of the bong, to prevent the ice from falling. <<|needle|>>After that, you can choose to put in the right amount of ice cubes and then extract the smoke. <<|needle|>>After the smoke has gone through multiple concerns and then cooled by ice cubes, you will feel the chills in your throat. <<|needle|>>Your throat won't choke on thick smoke. <<|needle|>>Newbies in the cannabis world can give it a try!\n\nWhat accessories does a bong usually have?\n\nWhat is their function?\n\nIt can be placed at the joint of the bong, and there are male and female distinctions. <<|needle|>>The male joint matches the female bowl, and vice versa. <<|needle|>>Its function is to place weed, and it can be ignited here. <<|needle|>>At the same time, for some smaller bongs, the function of the bowl also protects your face. <<|needle|>>Because the bong is relatively small, it is possible that the place where the weed is lit will be closer to the face, and the bowl can extend this distance and save your eyebrows from being burned.\n\nSometimes the bowl is not directly placed in the joint of the bong. <<|needle|>>Generally, the bong will have a matching downstem. <<|needle|>>Interestingly, downstems are also male and female. <<|needle|>>But the male joint matches the male downstem, and the male downstem matches the female bowl. <<|needle|>>Newbies in the cannabis world must be confused. <<|needle|>>It doesn't matter, try different bongs and accessories then you will learn more. <<|needle|>>The function of downstem is a simple downstem filter. <<|needle|>>It can be used as the first layer of filter for smoke entering the smoke chamber.\n\nSome bongs will design a inner filter or an outer filter to increase the filtering effect of the second layer. <<|needle|>>It is worth mentioning that the bubble effect produced by the filter is beautiful and strange.\n\nThe effect of the ice fork is a small ice room. <<|needle|>>It cools the smoke quickly enough that it doesn't burn down your throat, and it even gives you a cooling sensation when you suck in the smoke. <<|needle|>>There are many veterans who add ice cubes of different flavors to try out different tastes.\n\nIf you are interested in bongs, don't miss to follow us at Boteglass. <<|needle|>>Botel Glass Products Co., Ltd. <<|needle|>>is one of the most influential manufacturers of borosilicate glass products in China, specializing in the production of smoking accessories such as glass bongs, glass

Service] The Rev. <<|needle|>>Pauli Murray, a queer writer, lawyer and co-founder of the National Organization for Women who in 1977 became the first Black woman ordained an Episcopal priest, continues to inspire new generations of “firebrand” leaders to authenticity and activism.\n\nSimilarly, on Nov. <<|needle|>>3, 2020, the Rev. <<|needle|>>Kim Jackson, 36, vicar of Atlanta’s Church of the Common Ground, a ministry to homeless people, was elected Georgia’s first out LGBTQ state senator with nearly 80% of the vote.\n\nCelebrations commemorating Murray’s birthday on Nov. <<|needle|>>20, 1910, were held across the church. <<|needle|>>Both Johnson and Jackson paid homage recently to Murray, who was born Anna Pauline Murray but took the name Pauli and struggled with her sexuality and gender identity. <<|needle|>>As First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt’s “firebrand” friend, Murray chronicled her human rights activism in her autobiography, “Song in a Weary Throat,” published after her 1985 death. <<|needle|>>Her childhood home in Durham, North Carolina, is now the Pauli Murray Center for History and Social Justice and features “Pauli Talks,” a virtual series about current events through a Black and queer lens.\n\nCenter board member Jesse Huddleston, during a Dec. <<|needle|>>1 “Pauli Talks” year-in-review webcast, noted that Murray continues to inspire hope that not only is “another world possible, but another world is happening. <<|needle|>>We’re living proof of that.”\n\nMurray, who was added to The Episcopal Church’s calendar of saints in 2018, is a model for the inclusion of the gifts of those who are Black and queer, Huddleston said.The Rev. <<|needle|>>Pauli Murray’s childhood home in Durham, North Carolina, is a center for dialogue, the arts, education and community activism for all people. <<|needle|>>Photo courtesy of the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University\n\nDesignated a national historic landmark by the National Park Service in 2016, the center aims to reclaim Murray’s story, inspire a new generation of leaders, “and dismantle the discrimination she faced because of her race, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity,” according to director Barbara Lau. <<|needle|>>Only 2% of the 95,000 entries in the National Register of Historic Places focus on the experiences of African Americans, she said.\n\nCurrently, “there is a huge shift in public awareness around racial justice and racial reckoning,” Lau added. <<|needle|>>“When we look at the leadership of some of the most persistent movements aimed at that kind of justice, there’s young, Black, queer people in the lead. <<|needle|>>And there is less fear around claiming that identity.”\n\nThe Episcopal Church is planning to unveil a curriculum focused on Murray in January 2021. <<|needle|>>This lesson plan series will examine Murray’s complex story, which covers the gamut from faith to gender identity, and is geared toward middle schoolers, high schoolers and young adults.\n\nJackson, the Georgia state senator-elect, “identifies boldly as Black and queer,” a way of rejecting the kind of past shame that Murray and others have endured because of their gender identity, she said.“We will not be ashamed of what we look like and who we love and who we’re attracted to,” she told ENS recently. <<|needle|>>“Being Black and queer, that’s me. <<|needle|>>It’s different, but it’s not bad.”\n\nAfter joining The Episcopal Church as a seminarian more than a decade ago, Jackson discovered Murray, who resembled “people who looked like me and loved like me. <<|needle|>>This genderqueer woman, who was Black, who was politically engaged, who was also a priest – she modeled for me what I hope to achieve in my own life.”\n\nJackson, a native of South Carolina and a former Baptist, said her call to ordained ministry began at about age 8. <<|needle|>>Political aspirations followed five years later when she realized that both were ways to effect positive change.\n\nJackson explained that she dreams of a new kind of future for the homeless community she pastors, where barriers across class and race will crumble. <<|needle|>>Yet fear and the desire to return to normalcy could thwart the racial reckoning occurring within the culture and the church, she said.\n\n“Anti-Blackness is a disease that plagues our world,” she added. <<|needle|>>“As we are doing this work of trying to bring healing, we have to include racial reconciliation, racial justice, racial transformation. <<|needle|>>It is as essential to our well-being as it is to stamp out COVID-19.”\n\nThe pandemic and the virtual worship it has spawned have reduced geographic and class barriers to traditional church attendance, she said. <<|needle|>>“People who have to work on Sunday mornings because they have jobs that require that of them are now able to engage worship at a different time. <<|needle|>>I hope we will continue to build relationships with people beyond the walls of churches.”\n\nThe future church she hopes for also will be sensitive to language. <<|needle|>>“It matters to people when they hear me say, ‘siblings in Christ, we welcome you.’ It might not matter to the cis straight white guy who never heard of those terms. <<|needle|>>But for the nonconforming person, that matters, and it helps move us closer once again to the kingdom and the ‘kin-dom’ of God.” A cisgender straight person identifies with the gender assigned at birth and is attracted to members of the opposite sex.\n\nFor Johnson, who was consecrated bishop in June, the pandemic has been a time “to dream of the church that I’ve always wanted the church to be.”\n\nFrom Murray, he learned “to be who I am.” Initially that meant, in spite of sensing a call to ordained ministry at age 11, he didn’t think he would become a priest, much less a bishop, “because the church hasn’t always dealt too well with gay people.”Now, as bishop to a diocese of about 11,000 Episcopalians in the central and eastern half of Missouri, including the city of Ferguson, Johnson emphasizes racial reckoning as a priority. <<|needle|>>On Aug. <<|needle|>>9, 2014, Michael Brown Jr., an unarmed 18-year-old Black man, was fatally shot by a white police officer, sparking national attention and months of racial unrest in Ferguson.\n\n“As a church, we have come to a place where we are now invited to actually live out what we say we’re about,” Johnson said. <<|needle|>>“If the election a while ago taught us nothing, it should teach us as a church that we need to be about the business of reconciling God and God’s people.\n\n“The church is made for this moment. <<|needle|>>The church must be bold in this moment. <<|needle|>>This is what God called us into being for, to bring people together under a common goal. <<|needle|>>Like the presiding bishop says, love needs to be the way.”\n\nAlthough he represents multiple identities and numerous “firsts,” he says emphatically, “at the end of the day, I am called to serve the people of the Diocese of Missouri, and that’s what I’m going to do.”\n\nFor example, age makes Johnson “not a millennial, not a Gen Xer. <<|needle|>>I’m in that weird class called ‘Xennials,’” he says laughingly, which means “I grew up without technology but embraced it early on.”\n\nConsequently, the theme for the diocese’s Nov. <<|needle|>>19-21 convention was “Dreaming, Daring, Doing Together in Christ,” and also represents the moment the church was made for, he said. <<|needle|>>“Forget surviving. <<|needle|>>I want folks to thrive.”\n\nNot having all the answers is OK, Johnson added, “because that’s all the messiness of being God’s dream.”\n\n– The Rev. <<|needle|>>Pat McCaughan is a correspondent for Episcopal News Service based in Los Angeles, California.Liam Neeson is a modern American action film staple, best recognized for his ability to kick butt on screen—but Neeson can portray various roles. <<|needle|>>He has performed heartbreaking drama under Steven Spielberg’s direction in Schindler’s List and under Martin Scorsese’s direction in Gangs of New York and later Silence. <<|needle|>>He dabbled in science fiction in George Lucas’ Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace.\n\nHe dabbled in comedy with Seth MacFarlane’s A Million Ways to Die in the West, as well as smaller parts in Ted 2 and Family Guy. <<|needle|>>He enjoys children’s films such as The Chronicles of Narnia and Phil Lord, and Chris Miller’s The Lego Movie. <<|needle|>>He is, indeed, adaptable.\n\nHere is the list of the 10 greatest Liam Neeson moviesNeeson is at his most riveting and sad in Steven Spielberg’s haunting Oscar-winner as German businessman Oskar Schindler, who gradually becomes worried for his Jewish staff after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis in Poland during World War II. <<|needle|>>Neeson received a Best Actor nomination for his career-best performance, allowing the spectator to witness the horrors of the Holocaust through his eyes as it unfolded in real-time. <<|needle|>>His closing moment, like the film’s, is an all-timer.In this highly popular film, Neeson plays a sympathetic but occasionally amused widower attempting to assist his young stepson through his first romantic crush and the death of his mother. <<|needle|>>Unfortunately, the picture would eventually come to parallel Neeson’s actual life when his wife and sometime co-star actress Natasha Richardson (daughter of Vanessa Redgrave and director Tony Richardson) was murdered in a skiing accident, leaving Neeson to raise two young sons on his alone. <<|needle|>>This is one of Liam Neeson’s most well-known films, and he delivers an excellent performance, as does the rest of the vast ensemble cast.<image>It’ll be remembered as the Liam Neeson film, a throwaway B-movie about a retired CIA agent who travels across Europe to utilize his very specific set of abilities to save his estranged daughter, who has been kidnapped by traffickers while on a trip to Paris. <<|needle|>>Neeson’s career was revived rather than restarted, giving him the distinction of world’s coolest action hero – at the age of 56, no less! It spawned a couple of sequels and a slew of similar beat-’em-up payouts, allowing him to redefine himself and the genre.The dispute that had erupted between Woody Allen and his then-girlfriend and customary starring woman, Mia Farrow, overshadowed the release of this Woody Allen film. <<|needle|>>The film was published amid allegations that Allen raped their daughter Dylan and then had an affair with another of Farrow’s children, Soon-Yi Previn, with whom Allen would eventually marry and stay married to this day. <<|needle|>>Leaving that aside, the film provides a dynamic and frequently heartbreaking look at the challenges people face in intimate relationships.\n\nNeeson plays a sensitive magazine journalist entangled with the film’s two primary female characters, played by Farrow and Oscar contender Judy Davis. <<|needle|>>Neeson deserves credit for his cool, steady presence in this picture. <<|needle|>>He is frequently subjected to the whims and strong emotions of the two women with whom he is involved.In one of Scorsese’s most renowned but most polarising films, Neeson plays Priest Vallon, the head of one of two warring gangs in 1800s New York City. <<|needle|>>The Catholic gang is led by Neeson, while the protestant faction is led by Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher. <<|needle|>>When Bill murders Vallon, his young kid witnesses the attack. <<|needle|>>Years leader, the son comes (in the shape of Leonardo DiCaprio) to take on Bill and avenge his father’s death. <<|needle|>>While his screen time is limited, Neeson significantly affects the loving father. <<|needle|>>The death of the latter puts the wheels in motion for the film’s plot.In this biography, Neeson portrays Alfred Kinsey, a pioneering psychologist who investigated sexual behavior. <<|needle|>>Kinsey was one of the first people to focus only on human sexuality, publishing a seminal book on the subject in 1948. <<|needle|>>The film was critically lauded, and Neeson was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Independent Spirit Award for his performance. <<|needle|>>On Oscar night, he was overlooked, but his co-star Laura Linney did win a nod for Best Supporting Actress.Neeson played a pivotal and surprisingly evil role in the first of Christopher Nolan’s Batman films. <<|needle|>>After Gary Oldman declined to play Commissioner Gordon in the film, Nolan cast Neeson against type as the film’s crazed main villain. <<|needle|>>Nolan is claimed to have enjoyed the surprise factor that Neeson turns out to be the film’s most psychotic character after first revealing him as a sympathetic character (which Neeson normally plays). <<|needle|>>The picture was a big hit, and it spawned two critically-lauded sequels.Two Portuguese Jesuit priests journey to Japan in the 17th century searching for their mentor, who is reported to have committed apostasy. <<|needle|>>Neeson plays the lost Father Cristóvo Ferreira, who declares that Christianity is ineffective in Japan after experiencing severe torture and spending 15 years abroad. <<|needle|>>In Martin Scorsese’s difficult but magnificent historical drama, Neeson immerses himself in the highly nuanced role of a man who undergoes enough anguish to forsake his faith and leave behind a calling his protégés never believed he would.Neeson played a leading part in this picture, which stars Jodie Foster as a young woman who finds herself living alone in a remote cabin. <<|needle|>>The girl appears to speak her own language and appears to live an isolated life without interacting with anyone. <<|needle|>>Neeson plays the community doctor who is brought in to figure out how to talk to the girl. <<|needle|>>However, his only on-screen appearance is beside his wife Natasha Richardson, who portrays another doctor who joins the case to determine whether Nell is autistic or simply speaking in her native tongue because she never learned any other.<image>During the bleak “Meal Ticket” chapter of Joel and Ethan Coen’s magnificent Western saga, told in six parts, Neeson performs in silence. <<|needle|>>He plays an aged impresario who, with the help of a young guy with no arms or legs, goes from town to town in a cart that changes into a little stage on which the young man recites ancient poems and monologues. <<|needle|>>When the gruff Neeson sees a chicken reportedly performing math problems to amuse his shrinking crowds, he switches out his talent…in an inflammatory way. <<|needle|>>Neeson’s work is underappreciated and subtle.Retail observation 1: A couple of months ago, Bella Caledonia, an on-line magazine reported that Harrod’s Department store in London’s Knightsbridge was selling wild salmon at £245/kg which they say equates to around £60 per portion. <<|needle|>>Bella Caledonia readers must have a healthy appetite for salmon because a 140g portion would actually cost £34.30. <<|needle|>>The salmon comes from the River Tweed and because it is illegal to sell most wild salmon from Scotland, Bella Caledonia found out that a small fishery is still operating legally. <<|needle|>>This is because when Marine Scotland arranged for a ban on netting in coastal waters, they forgot to extend the ban to in-river fisheries. <<|needle|>>In 2020, a total of 780 wild salmon were caught and sold to restaurants and boutique fishmongers.\n\nBella Caledonia asked the fishmonger in Harrods who was buying the £63 (sic) portion wild salmon. <<|needle|>>The reply was ‘rich people’.\n\nBella Caledonia rued the loss of wild salmon and although blamed a number of factors, focused on just one, which I don’t need to mention.\n\nInstead, I would suggest that whilst there is the odd person willing to buy wild salmon from Harrods at £245/kg, the majority of their consumers, however rich, appear happy to buy farmed salmon at £28/kg for fillet and £20/kg for steaks. <<|needle|>>Of course, high end consumers like to buy something different from the standard offerings so Harrods currently stock fresh salmon from the Faroe Islands. <<|needle|>>This does not mean that they ignore Scottish as they have a range of Scottish smoked salmon too.\n\nTo put the price of Harrods salmon into context, Waitrose sell Hebridean salmon fillet for £24.99/kg which is not such a big difference given the difference between the stores.\n\nRetail observation 2: Last month there was a media storm because a shopper at a Morrison’s store in Salford posted a picture of a ‘baby’ octopus being sold for just 36p. <<|needle|>> The shopper, a charity worker, declared himself heartbroken on Twitter saying that one of the most amazing creatures ever to swim the seas has been moved from its ocean home to our rubbish bin.\n\nThe 176g octopus had been priced at £1.41 equivalent to £8/kg but because it was approaching its sell by date, the price had been reduced first to £1.06 and then down to 36p or £2/kg. <<|needle|>> The charity worker said that these are beautiful, sentient creatures and we as humans, by putting so little value on them, do not deserve this world. <<|needle|>>His comments on Twitter received over 43,000 likes which he put down to the popularity of the 2020 Netflix documentary My Octopus Teacher.These comments raise a number of issues, not least, the presence of octopus in retail stores. <<|needle|>>The problem for retailers like Morrison’s who stocked the octopus, is that the message from the fisheries sector is to eat a wider range of fish species and this would include octopus.\n\nIf stores don’t stock a choice of fish and seafood, then consumers would be just exposed to the Big Five (salmon, cod, haddock, tuna & prawns) and little else. <<|needle|>>Yet at the same time, consumers are not going to move off the Big Five unless there is a choice and regrettably, having a choice means that some lesser desirable species are never bought.\n\nMorrisons are one of the few supermarkets still to operate a fish counter. <<|needle|>>The fishmonger also wraps some of the produce for display on the shelves, as happened in this example. <<|needle|>>Their recent strategy has been to promote more UK caught fish and whilst I am not party to their sales, it does seem to me that there has been a high level of wastage with consumers failing to be motivated to buy alternative locally caught species.\n\nIn response to the charity worker’s description of the octopus as a baby, Morrisons said that this was the most commonly caught species of octopus in Cornwall, which is much smaller than the common octopus.\n\nThere is clearly a taste for octopus in the UK, as the last twelve months, consumers have bought around 100 tonnes of octopus. <<|needle|>>Although it is not exactly a big seller, sales have increased by a quarter over the last twelve months. <<|needle|>>However, I suspect that Salford is not a hotbed of octopus consumption as it is not an affluent area, even though the species costs just £8/kg. <<|needle|>>By coincidence, I regularly visit this specific store and the octopus offering was somewhat unusual. <<|needle|>>The fish counter offers just a relatively simply range of species.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the charity worker is also a vegan and I have heard him interviewed on the radio and whist the price caught his attention, he equally objects to eating any fish or seafood. <<|needle|>>Sadly, many of those now objecting to aquaculture developments have a vegan lifestyle. <<|needle|>>Unfortunately, they seem to think that the rest of us should follow their lifestyle too and stop eating animals. <<|needle|>>They would be better served by promoting their lifestyle rather than criticising what the rest of us eat.\n\nRetail Observation 3: One of my correspondents has pointed out a recent tweet. <<|needle|>>It says that one kg of wild mackerel costs £11.50/kg whilst one kg of ‘toxic‘ salmon is priced at only £5.99/kg. <<|needle|>>The tweet was accompanied by pictures taken in a Morrisons store.The implication is that salmon farmers must give away their fish at a low price as otherwise consumers would avoid it. <<|needle|>>Unfortunately, this industry critic has interpreted what was observed in line with typical anti-salmon farming narrative when in fact the truth is very different.\n\nFirstly, as discussed above, the pack illustrated has been reduced in price because such alternative species are not especially attractive to consumers familiar with the Big Five. <<|needle|>>Secondly, the label states that the mackerel is prepared, whereas whole mackerel usually costs just £6/kg.Secondly, the salmon which is sold as a whole fish normally costs £8/kg but as the label clearly states, the fish is on special promotion. <<|needle|>>Boneless salmon fillet, which is what consumers prefer to buy, retails at £13.99/kg.\n\nFortunately, the salmon is only toxic in the eyes of critics because the truth is that salmon is the top seller in the UK with nearly 64,000 tonnes sold in the last twelve months. <<|needle|>>By comparison, only 16,000 tonnes of mackerel were sold. <<|needle|>>Clearly UK consumers don’t consider salmon to be toxic and that’s because it isn’t. <<|needle|>>Perhaps, the reason little note is taken of the critics is that because the average consumer understands that it is the critics who are toxic.\n\nRetail Observation 4: Another critic has posted a picture of a pack of Tesco Finest smoked salmon which states the name of the farms where the salmon was grown. <<|needle|>>The critic then equates the salmon lice data for the same date with the smoked salmon in the pack suggesting that it comes from fish which were then highly infested.\n\nThe sea lice data for the farm is taken directly from the company website. <<|needle|>>At the time, the farm experienced a level of over 4 lice. <<|needle|>>This was prior to treatment after which the numbers fell to less than one. <<|needle|>>This is against a background of a reporting level of 2 and an action level of six lice.\n\nWhilst it is easy to assume that the salmon in the pack comes from the same pen as fish under treatment, this is another example of a critic adapting observation to fit in with their own narrative. <<|needle|>>It is a shame that this critic didn’t bother to read other information on the pack rather than just the site name and the data. <<|needle|>>The pack states that ‘This product may have been previously frozen and has been restored to chill temperature under carefully controlled conditions’. <<|needle|>>Smoked salmon is often frozen in order to regulate supply with demand. <<|needle|>>Just because the date, which is typically a use by date, is current, does not mean that is the same date as when the salmon was smoked.\n\nApparently, this is not the first time these claims have been posted and I understand that the company involved responded fully at the time. <<|needle|>>However, as the response was not the answer the critic wanted to hear, it was reposted again in the hope of ascribing to the theory that people will eventually believe what you say if you repeat it often enough. <<|needle|>>To date, most right-minded consumers clearly ignore these claims since in the last twelve months UK consumers bought 118 million packs of smoked salmon. <<|needle|>>That is a lot of smoked salmon.The Top Fitness, Beauty, and Wellness Tips from Zendaya\n\nFew Disney fans or Marvel fans can say that they’ve never heard of Zendaya Coleman. <<|needle|>>The Emmy Award-winning actress, dancer, and singer has been gracing audiences with her presence since she played Rocky Blue in Disney Channel’s Shake It Up between 2010 and 2013 opposite Bella Thorne, and since then she’s gone on to gain accolades for her more dramatic roles like Rue Bennett in Euphoria (for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, making her the youngest recipient on record). <<|needle|>>She’s also been in blockbusters like The Greatest Showman (2017) or Dune (2021), but most Disney fans and Marvel fans will know her now as MJ, the love interest of Peter Parker in the Tom Holland Spider-Man movie franchise.Zendaya as MJ and Tom Holland as Peter Parker in ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ Credit: Screenrant.com\n\nSince the latest Tom Holland Spider-Man movie Spider-Man: No Way Home was just released and includes a shocking finale, Zendaya has been the talk of the town once again. <<|needle|>>She’s also been receiving lots of attention from the public since she and co-star Tom Holland seem to have finally confirmed their ongoing off-screen relationship. <<|needle|>>With Zendaya being the focus of the public eye once again and New Year’s resolutions rolling in, it’s the perfect time to look back at some of the actress’s best insights when it comes to wellness, fitness, and beauty!\n\nWith mental health becoming a bigger and bigger issue in recent years, it’s understandable that Zendaya is an advocate of therapy. <<|needle|>>“Yeah, of course I go to therapy,” she told British Vogue in a recent interview. <<|needle|>>“I mean, if anybody is able to possess the financial means to go to therapy, I would recommend they do that. <<|needle|>>I think it’s a beautiful thing. <<|needle|>>You know, there’s nothing wrong with working on yourself and dealing with those things with someone who can help you, someone who can talk to you, who’s not your mom or whatever. <<|needle|>>Who has no bias.”<image>Many Disney fanatics might not know that Zendaya has her own website, but she does, and there are several resources on zendaya.com about anxiety or insomnia. <<|needle|>>In the zendaya.com article about alleviating anxiety, one of the first paragraphs says that “self-care is key! Make sure to get enough sleep, nutritious meals, exercise (daily if you can), and limit alcohol and caffeine (both can make anxiety worse)”. <<|needle|>>Diet-wise, Zendaya is a vegetarian, but she loves comfort food like an In-N-Out grilled cheese!\n\nZendaya has been featured in many videos (and on her own website) without wearing any makeup at all, so the actress definitely seems to be an advocate for barefaced natural makeup or natural beauty! However, Zendaya also doesn’t hesitate to bring dramatic or unexpected looks to the red carpet when it comes to press tours, award ceremonies, and movie premieres. <<|needle|>>She’s often considered one of the fashion industry’s most popular celebrities, and Vogue just named her one of the twelve best-dressed women of 2021 alongside other Marvel actors like Gemma Chan and Angelina Jolie!\n\nWhen she’s doing graphic makeup or dramatic looks, Zendaya has said that she loves a red lip and a little winged eyeliner on the outer corner of the eye. <<|needle|>>You can also see some of her makeup tips in the video directly below, such as enhancing eyebrows in a natural way and applying eyeliner with open eyes!\n\nThe performer has a long-standing partnership with Lancôme, so it’s not surprising that her skincare before red carpet appearances focuses heavily on that brand’s products. <<|needle|>>However, Zendaya has also shared her simplified skincare routine, saying that “it’s so important to take care of your skin and pamper it before you go to bed”. <<|needle|>>Her first step is removing “any makeup and dirt with Shea Moisture African Black Soup Facial Cleansing Wipes. <<|needle|>>One of my biggest tips for keeping your skin clear is to wash your makeup off before you go to bed. <<|needle|>>There are no excuses!” the article says.\n\nZendaya’s second skincare step is toner — specifically the classic Thayers toner, which Lily Collins is also a fan of. <<|needle|>>“With cotton pads, I apply rose water witch hazel as a toner. <<|needle|>>It’s really refreshing and has a nice, soft scent,” Zendaya wrote. <<|needle|>>Lastly, she wrote that “I smooth on vitamin e oil, which makes my skin look fresh and feel so soft by the morning”. <<|needle|>>She also pointed out that “Vitamin E Oil rejuvenates and blocks free radicals, which contribute to the aging process”. <<|needle|>>In another article, Zendaya specifically spoke about the beauty products that help her with acne, saying that “every girl needs a few secret weapons to keep their skin clear”.\n\nThe first skincare product Zendaya uses for acne is the same Vitamin E oil from the Body Shop as previously mentioned. <<|needle|>>The other two products are the Mario Badescu Ceramide Eye Gel (“this eye gel helps de-puff my under eyes and keep the skin hydrated”, Zendaya wrote) and the Mario Badescu Oil-Free Moisturizer (“this moisturizer protects against sun damage, doesn’t clog my pores, and contains green tea extract, a great antioxidant!” she said).\n\nAlthough Zendaya mainly seems to use Lancôme skincare products now, she has still shared some other skincare products that are key to her confidence. <<|needle|>>In one of her articles, she says the following: “What helps me feel confident? A lot of things contribute but having a good skincare routine makes all the difference. <<|needle|>>Pampering my skin and seeing the results from that is so relaxing and really boosts my confidence. <<|needle|>>When your skin feels poppin’ you feel poppin’— you’re glowing from the inside out!”. <<|needle|>>The Origins Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask, La Mer The Intensive Revitalizing Mask , PurErb Purity Renewing Moisturizer (which a Spider-Man makeup artist recommended to her), and the PurErb Vitality Deep Cleansing Oil all made the cut.As far as fitness goes, Zendaya is not averse to using little psychological tricks to motivate herself for a workout. <<|needle|>>During quarantine in 2020, the actress and her well-known assistant Darnell Appling began a workout regimen together — and in an effort to stick with the routine and distract herself from the workout, Zendaya apparently got into the habit of “dressing up in wigs and embodying different characters each time, just to bring a little hilarity to whatever workout they’re up to”.\n\nWhen she’s playing a dancer like Rocky Blue or an acrobatic trapeze artist like Anne Wheeler in The Greatest Showman, Zendaya obviously has to amp up her workouts a bit. <<|needle|>>“Find something that’s actually fun for you,” she told Justine Magazine. <<|needle|>>“Dancing” and “fight choreography” are enjoyable for Zendaya automatically, making it much easier for her to prepare for her roles and stay healthy in between shoots.\n\nDo you find Zendaya inspiring? Are you going to try any of her fitness tricks, skincare products, or wellness recommendations for this New Year?Yes, but the words “irrespective of the Militia” are key to dispel the myth that madison (the poster, not the founder) was trying to promote.No liberal is going to come and take your guns. <<|needle|>>Come to your senses.\n\nYeah well tell that to Kamala Harris who said in the first 100 days of her Presidency she will issue a gun grabbing EO!\n\nThis is the danger of socialist Dems who are so desperate to regain and retain power over the country, the military and law enforcement which they will turn on Americans and use them to do their UN-Constitutional dirty work and once the Government has control of health care and ignores the 2nd Amendment with gun confiscation we are doomed to servitude, aka slavery!\n\nNOT going to happen in the USA without bloody results. <<|needle|>>Dems will literally turn Americans against each other and devour the country and will be happy to rule over the leftover crumbs.\n\nI guess they’ll be pried from your cold dead fingers…\n\n“Bingo, you’re right if you have an assault weapon,” said Biden. <<|needle|>>“The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period. <<|needle|>>Look, the Second Amendment doesn’t say you can’t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own. <<|needle|>>You can’t buy a bazooka.‘Bingo’: Biden says he’s coming for your guns if you have an assault weapon\n\nDuring an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Monday, former Vice President Joe Biden said that he intends to ban assault weapons if elected president, and he would accompany it with a national gun buyback program to eliminate as many existing...\n\nThey haven’t got the courage of their convictions and can’t understand people who do.\n\nThey also don’t care how bloody the operations will be, how many innocents will be killed and wounded as long as eventually they are successful.\n\nNOT going to happen in the USA without bloody results.\n\nSomething the right relishes and talks about endlessly, as though it is to be sought after…\n\nStating a factual outcome is not to wish for it, it’s a warning of what is to come.\n\nThose who support gun bans should be forced to physically and personally take away the guns from their neighbors.\n\nThey also don’t care how bloody the operations will be, how many innocents will be killed and wounded as long as eventually they are successful.\n\nOf course not they don’t care how many left standing as long as they can control whats left.\n\nThose are all sound options…\n\nThe idiot. <<|needle|>>Of course you can buy a bazooka. <<|needle|>>They are not even controlled by the ATF.\n\nAt least he didn’t say “nuclear bomb” even though he would have been right about that.\n\nThe population today is estimated at 329.16 million and of them, an estimated 20% own guns, which yields 65.83 million gun owners.\n\nStatistically, the number of gun owners is identical to what it was 40 years ago.\n\nFurthermore, the percentage of households with guns ha remained fairly static too. <<|needle|>>In 1980 about 42% of households reportedly had at least one gun in it. <<|needle|>>That number today is 43%. <<|needle|>>And that is based on polling … gun owners as a group are reluctant to tell a stranger conducting a poll that kind of information.\n\nApproximately 39% of American homes have at least one firearm today. <<|needle|>>We’re actually on the increase.\n\nSingle women are the most rapidly growing market particularly for handguns as they are learning their value in self defense since they empower the weak to defend against stronger attackers.\n\nThey are also the most rapidly growing demographic for firearms and self defense training.\n\nThis is a major demographic shift that is going to change voting patterns in the future particularly with respect to suburban and urban women whom the democrats have had pretty much a lock on for two decades.\n\nThose women are serious about their gun and self defense rights and their numbers are growing exponentially.\n\nThanks for setting this straight!!\n\nGun owners are not going to tell anonymous pollsters if they have firearms. <<|needle|>>Not worth revealing and counter to safety training. <<|needle|>>You will not know I have a firearm until I determine it needs to be used.\n\nGun owners are not going to tell anonymous pollsters if they have firearms.\n\nShit, they post up the number of guns they own, the types, even pictures of them, right here on this forum for god and everybody to see…\n\nThanks for setting this straight!!Despite mass shootings, number of households owning guns is on the decline\n\nHalf of all guns are concentrated among 3 percent of Americans\n\nBtw, why would liberal media outlets be fabricating data suggesting that the number of gun owners is declining…Over the years Makita has built an impressive tool lineup for its excellent 18V battery system. <<|needle|>>This system offers more choices than any other battery system available today. <<|needle|>>The LXDT04CW impact driver fills the spot of the compact, yet powerful everyday driver in the lineup. <<|needle|>>Let's take a look at how it did in our shop.\n\nUnlike most Makita tools the LXDT04CW is styled in white instead of the traditional turquoise. <<|needle|>>The LXDT04CW is part of Makita's \"compact\" line of tools, which are all designed in white. <<|needle|>>The attribute of \"compact\" refers mainly to the smaller 18V battery battery, which is half the size of a full LXT battery. <<|needle|>>The tool itself is no smaller or less powerful than the regular, turquoise LXDT04. <<|needle|>>In fact, the two tools have identical specs.The LXDT04CW was designed primarily for driving fasteners. <<|needle|>>It is equipped with a metal 1/4\" quick connect hex chuck. <<|needle|>>The relatively short body houses a surprisingly powerful motor. <<|needle|>>The tool's torque numbers are high enough to put it into the mid field of the market, which is where most well-designed impact drivers reside.\n\nWith the battery installed the driver's balance point is just below the trigger. <<|needle|>>This makes the tool very comfortable to use. <<|needle|>>The body and battery combine to form a single unit that is free of rattles or bending parts. <<|needle|>>The whole driver has been engineered and built to survive on a job site. <<|needle|>>The bottom of the battery is strong enough for nudging parts into place, which is an essential attribute of any driver.Makita equipped the LXDT04CW with an LED work light just above the trigger. <<|needle|>>When the trigger is pressed the work light comes on and stays on until 15 seconds after the trigger is released. <<|needle|>>This eliminates the need to keep constant pressure on the trigger to activate the light. <<|needle|>>The work light itself is powerful enough to make the driver useful as an emergency flashlight. <<|needle|>>Illumination at the work area is excellent.\n\nThe forward/reverse switch is the common through-the-body design design. <<|needle|>>It's located just behind the trigger. <<|needle|>>The switch is far enough back to not get into the way, but close enough to be within reach of the trigger finger. <<|needle|>>The center location of the switch locks the trigger.\n\nThe belt-hook near the battery is well designed. <<|needle|>>It keeps the driver from shifting too much on your toolbelt. <<|needle|>>The weight of the battery remains above the hook creating a nice balance for the motor below the hook. <<|needle|>>If you do not use tool belts, the belt hook can be removed. <<|needle|>>Left-handers can move the hook to the other side of the tool to maintain proper tool orientation while holstering.<image>An area where Makita innovates is in making brush changes faster and easier. <<|needle|>>Instead of the traditional two-piece clamshell design, the engineers at Makita added a third body piece that covers the rear of the tool. <<|needle|>>This piece acts as the motor cover. <<|needle|>>It can be removed by loosening two screws. <<|needle|>>This exposes the rear of the electric motor and the brush assembly.\n\nWhile one does not have to change brushes on a driver every day, this feature is non-the-less a very useful addition. <<|needle|>>The driver's structural integrity does not seem to suffer because of the addition of the extra body panel.\n\nAs expected the good torque numbers of its motor make the LXDT04 a good performer in the shop. <<|needle|>>The driver had no trouble driving 3\" screws through plywood into farming lumber. <<|needle|>>The hammer action only engaged to sink the head of the screw below the surface. <<|needle|>>The driver certainly has enough power to call it \"construction grade\". <<|needle|>>It'll perform like an impact driver should perform.\n\nOn the high end the LXDT04CW slowed down significantly when driving lag bolts with a socket installed in the chuck. <<|needle|>>While the motor on the driver is perfectly suited for driving fasteners, it does not reach into the territory of impact wrenches.\n\nThe body of the driver gets noticeably hot during heavy use, but does not slow down. <<|needle|>>After spending an entry battery pack on driving 3\" screws into 2x4s the LXDT04CW did not need a cool-down break. <<|needle|>>It picked up where it left off after a quick battery change.\n\nBattery life during the test was limited due to the compact battery. <<|needle|>>As expected the battery lasted about half as long as tools with full size batteries. <<|needle|>>The LXDT04CW strong point is its size, not it's staying power. <<|needle|>>The driver was a joy to use. <<|needle|>>With its small, compact body driving screws was a pleasure. <<|needle|>>All this maneuverability comes at the price of more frequent battery changes.Makita's 18V lineup of tools is very diverse and complete. <<|needle|>>The batteries used by LXDT04 can be used on an array of excellent cordless power tools. <<|needle|>>This diversity is a strong argument for the LCDT04CW and the Makita 18V LXT system.\n\nThe regular version of the LXDT04CW is the LXDT04, which comes in turquoise. <<|needle|>>Both models share the same specs, but the LXDT04 comes with a full size battery pack instead of a regular pack.\n\nThe LCDT01 is the top tool in Makita's current lineup. <<|needle|>>It adds a brushless motor for more torque, longer life, and higher performance in general. <<|needle|>>The LXDT04CW provides almost the same level of performance at a lower price.The LXDT04CW impact driver is a powerful, compact tool that excels at driving a limited number of fasteners at a time. <<|needle|>>It's compact size makes the tool maneuverable and usable in tight spaces. <<|needle|>>The driving process is fast and controlled.\n\nThe small battery limits the LXDT04CW staying power on large projects. <<|needle|>>The battery drains too fast and slows down work. <<|needle|>>The regular LXDT04 with it's full size battery is a better choice for these tasks.\n\nOverall Makita has designed a great tool for occasional users. <<|needle|>>The smaller battery pack drives down costs for users who do not have to drive a lot of fasteners at a time. <<|needle|>>Contractors and homeowners alike will welcome the professional quality Makita built into the LXDT04CW. <<|needle|>>This driver makes the right compromises to be a great tool for many of us.Hairstreaks, the subfamily (Theclinae) of butterflies in the Lycaenidae family, are generally, but not always identified by the small protruding hair at the bottom of the tail.\n\nMost of the one hundred or so hairstreak species live in a geographically limited range. <<|needle|>>The Gray Hairstreak is an exception to that rule, with a range extending throughout most of the United States.\n\nHairstreaks divide into around a dozen different genera, with approximately two-thirds of the species belonging to one of three genera: Callophyrs; Satyrium; Strymon.\n\nHairstreak butterflies identification starts out straight forward, with the patterns on the underside of the wings serving as the basic identification clues. <<|needle|>>Most species are relatively small, the size of a penny or nickle when the wings are folded, so getting a large, accurate picture might be the most difficult identification task.Elfin butterflies are a group of hairstreaks in the Callophrys genus often adopt a common name based on their habitat, such as the Desert Elfin and the Bog Elfin. <<|needle|>>One of the less colorful elfin species, the Brown Elfin (Callophrys augustinus), takes its common name from the relatively plain brown wings. <<|needle|>>Small populations of Brown Elfins thrive in most forest areas of North America, principally because their larvae have adapted to feeding on a variety of native plants, including blueberries.\n\nCallophrys also literally translates into green butterflies. <<|needle|>>Please press the button to see many more of the Callophrys species.Many, but not all Satyrium caterpillars feed on oak leaves, the Behr’s hairstreak pictured, represents an exception to the rule. <<|needle|>>They are western butterflies with a range extending from east of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountains to the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.Its extended range can be attributed to its adaptability. <<|needle|>>A variety of flowering plants, including members of the pea and mallow family serve as larval host plants. <<|needle|>>Adults also nectar on a variety of flowers.\n\nThe top picture shows its characteristic gray wings with orange spots on the border next to the protruding tail hairs.\n\nThey blue/gray wings means it could easily be mistaken as a blue butterfly. <<|needle|>>The presence of a tail is the first field identification clue. <<|needle|>>It is a bit larger in size compared to other hairstreak species.\n\nA Note on Strymon Butterflies<image>Four additional genera of hairstreak butterflies have the Latin name strymon, with an adjective preceding it. <<|needle|>>The first four pictures in this section cover them.\n\nWhile butterfly taxa continues to change as DNA research continues, the easiest way to describe these similar genera is to say they are all basically subtropical species with a physical similarity.\n\nFor example, the Clytie Ministreak (Ministrymon clytie), one of three native North American Ministrymon, inhabit areas of the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas and Southern Arizona. <<|needle|>>The name Ministrymon makes sense as it physically resembles a smaller version of a butterfly in the Strymon genera.\n\nA British entomologist named Adria Hoskins explained it this way:\n\nThe genus is named after the Greek river Strymon. <<|needle|>>It refers to the river-like ‘hairstreak’ line on the underside of many Eumaeini genera including Strymon, Hypostrymon, Nesiostrymon, Ministrymon, Chlorostrymon and Electrostrymon. <<|needle|>>In many species this streak is indistinct or is broken up into a series of spots.\n\nThe double tail and orange striped pattern on the underside of the wings are good field identification clues.Leda Ministreaks (Ministrymon) are the second of the genera and they are the Southwest species.Soapberry Hairstreak (Phaeostrymon alcestis) are also a one of a genus species related to the Strymon and they are a Southwest species.Great Purple Hairstreaks (Atides halesus) also contribute to the colorful hairstreak world. <<|needle|>>Larvae feed on mistletoe and adults prefer wooded habitat. <<|needle|>>They can be found in many southern areas of the United States that provide suitable habitat.Golden Hairstreaks are the sole member of the Habrodais genus. <<|needle|>>They are a West Coast species.\n\nAtala (Eumaeus atala) also bring the color to Hairstreaks. <<|needle|>>They are a Florida specialty and the only species in the genera in the United States. <<|needle|>>Beachgoers can look for them along the Southeast cost.The Dusky-blue Groundstreak (Calycopis isobeon), one of two native calycopis species, inhabits forest areas in the subtropical Americas from Venezuela in the South, to South Texas in the north. <<|needle|>>Occasionally southern Arizona hosts a few visitors.\n\nThe picture highlights the insect’s dark orange markings, especially on the hindwing. <<|needle|>>The sky blue spot on the hindwing, directly under the second pair of tails adds another bit of flash.<image>Red-banded Hairstreaks are the other Calycopis species. <<|needle|>>They too are a sub-tropical specialty.White-M Hairstreak (Parrhasius m album) are fairly common in the Eastern United States. <<|needle|>>They are the sole representative of the genus.Marius Hairstreak (Rekoa marius) one of two native rekoa species is a visitor to South Texas.Vinyl Conflict record shop has announced that Nickelus F’s new album, Stuck, will be released on the shop’s locals-only label, Vinyl Conflict Records, later this summer with an edition of 500 copies. <<|needle|>>The album was originally released on AGM on May 11 as a digital-only release.\n\nVinyl Conflict is known throughout the region for its selection of punk, metal, and hardcore records. <<|needle|>>Bobby Egger, owner and operator of Vinyl Conflict, started the locals-only imprint almost a decade ago to showcase punk and hardcore groups from Richmond. <<|needle|>>Nickelus F will be the first hip-hop artist on the label.“[Bobby] reached out to me and asked about you know, would I be interested in having it on vinyl,” said Nickelus F, “I said, ‘fuck yeah.’ Damn right I want to have it on vinyl.”\n\nNickelus F is a prolific underground hip hop artist who has been releasing music in Richmond since the mid 2000s. <<|needle|>>He was known early on for his appearances on BET’s 106 & Park “Freestyle Friday” and for his guest spots on several Drake songs. <<|needle|>>In 2011 he collaborated with Ohbliv for the mixtape Yellow Gold, and in 2015 he released Trick Dice with Lil Ugly Mane. <<|needle|>>He produces and writes records at a fast pace, and has released a solo album every year for the last three years.\n\nDIY punk labels and hip hop artists have been collaborating more often in recent years, and there is history between the two genres that dates back to the early 90s when Public Enemy and Anthrax teamed up on “Bring the Noise”.\n\nMore recently, Brooklyn rapper Ill Bill recently released a split single with Ghoul on Tankcrimes records, and Austin punk label 540 Records has released several hip hop records now, but the underground punk and hip hop scenes in Richmond have not yet crossed paths, which makes this release a unique event. <<|needle|>>Nickelus F, already a fan of punk and metal in the city, sees plenty of similarities between the two genres.\n\n“I think the underground nature of my music, the rawness of it, and the attitude of it, is very punk and very rock,” said Nickelus F. <<|needle|>>“I feel like people identify with that about my music. <<|needle|>>I like the punk rock way of doing things, I like the grind of it all.”DIY punk labels like Vinyl Conflict don’t operate like major labels. <<|needle|>>Short runs of vinyl releases are produced without a contract between the label and the artist, and the artist receives a portion of the copies to sell on their own at concerts.\n\n“The thing that’s dope about the way that Vinyl Conflict runs is that, its like, you get on the grind and you do this,” he said. <<|needle|>>“Like, we’ll give you these records whatever, its up to you to sell them though, its up to you to get out there and rock these shows and make people want to buy this shit. <<|needle|>>And that’s always been my mindset going into things anyway.”\n\nThe Richmond hip hop scene has been growing in recent years, and there are now more events and open mics than there used to be in the city. <<|needle|>>Monthly events like RVA Lyricists Lounge are helping bring people together in the community, and the gathering has become a place where young, aspiring rappers can cut their teeth.\n\n“We went through some really really dark times out here,” said Nickelus F. <<|needle|>>“I think we’re raising the integrity of the art that comes out from the city when it comes to hip hop artists.”\n\nEgger is excited for the upcoming release Vinyl Conflict records, and has several other hip hop releases planned for the near future. <<|needle|>>He was surprised to learn that Nickelus F was dialed into the punk scene well before they agreed to do the record, and that his favorite local metal band is Cough.\n\nNickelus F said that he’s never been to a Richmond metal show, but that it’s something he wants to do this year.Nickelus F and Lil Ugly Mane are going on a short tour at the beginning of August, and will be playing Vinyl Conflict’s Customer Appreciation Day concert on August 25 alongside hardcore punk bands Bib, Nosebleed, Deviant, and Slump.\n\nVirginia rapper Pusha-T’s latest album, Daytona, released May 25 via G.O.O.D. <<|needle|>>Music, has unleashed some intense backlash for what some believe is crude cover artwork. <<|needle|>>The controversial cover photo depicts late singer Whitney Houston’s drug-covered bathroom sink taken on the night of her death in 2012.\n\nKanye West, who produced the album, reportedly switched the cover art for the album at 1 am on the morning of its release after paying $85,000 to license the photo. <<|needle|>>Pusha-T told radio host Angie Martinez that the photo of Houston’s bathroom was not the original artwork, but that West changed it at the last second because he, “wasn’t feeling it.”\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone, Houston’s estate was extremely disappointed in West’s decision to change the cover. <<|needle|>>“Even in Whitney’s death, we see that no one is exempt from the harsh realities of the world,” said her estate in a statement to ET on Tuesday. <<|needle|>>In an interview with Rolling Stone, Houston’s ex-husband Bobby Brown called the album cover disgusting, and said that West, “needs somebody to slap him or something.”\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Pusha-T also escalated his long-running feud with Canadian rapper Drake. <<|needle|>>The dispute finally boiled over with the release of “Infrared,” the final track on Daytona where Pusha-T calls out Drake for using ghostwriters in his songs. <<|needle|>>Drake fired back on the same day with “Duppy Freestyle,” in which he calls Pusha-T a hypocrite since his producer, Kanye West, has publicly acknowledged his use of ghostwriters. <<|needle|>>Drake was a credited songwriter on West’s Life of Pablo.\n\nThe disagreements surrounding Pusha-T’s new release are eerily similar to the manufactured publicity stunts that often accompany West’s album and product releases. <<|needle|>>West is adept at stoking strong emotions from his fan base to ramp up publicity and create fodder for gossip columns.\n\nThe controversy did not stop there, however. <<|needle|>>According to Ian Sams, a communications manager for Senator Tim Kaine, who took to Twitter, the controversy has even taken hold in the UK with press outreach asking Kaine to weigh in on the drama.<image>For those who were unaware of how these things connect: Kaine campaigned with Pusha-T in Florida during Hillary Clinton’s run for President in 2016.\n\n2015 might be defined by a lot of things… Syria, ISIS, domestic terrorism, and Drake’s new hit single “Hotline Bling.”\n\nEND_OF_DOCUMENT_TOKEN_TO_BE_REPLACED\n\nWho the hell thought of putting a music festival in

celebrated of the Armistice that ended the First World War. <<|needle|>>For the occasion, a grand ball was held at London’s Royal Albert Hall. <<|needle|>>Top of the bill was the hugely popular Southern Syncopated Orchestra, one of the first jazz bands to visit Britain, Scotland, and Ireland.\n\nThe Orchestra took the nation by storm and helped breathe joy back into Edwardian Britain. <<|needle|>>The SSO transformed the London club scene and was the first band of black musicians to play at the fashionable Brighton Dome. <<|needle|>>Arriving there in August 1921, they stayed for a month.\n\nTragedy would bring an end to this chapter of musical history. <<|needle|>>In October, it will be hundred years ago that the SS Rowan sank off the Scottish coast.The Southern Syncopated Orchestra (SSO) started life in 1918 as the New York Syncopated Orchestra. <<|needle|>>Formed by African-American classically trained composer and violinist Will Marion Cook, the band was made up of twenty-seven musicians and nineteen singers. <<|needle|>>Performers came from New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, Guyana, Barbados, Antigua, and Ghana among other places.\n\nBorn in Washington, Cook would become one of the most important figures in the pre-jazz era. <<|needle|>>After the death of his father, he was sent to Chattanooga, Tennessee, to live with his grandfather where he heard black folk music for the first time, but his career remained focused on classical music. <<|needle|>>From 1887 to 1889 he studied at Berlin’s Hochschule für Musik with Joseph Joachim, the famous violinist and associate of Johannes Brahms.\n\nUpon his return, he continued his studies at New York’s National Conservatory for Music at West 25th Street where Antonin Dvořák was teaching. <<|needle|>>Unable to find employment at any musical institution, he turned his considerable talent to popular music. <<|needle|>>His first big success was the musical Clorindy: The Origin of the Cakewalk (1898) performed at the Casino Roof Garden on Broadway.\n\nOutside the theater world, Cook gained respect as a choral and orchestral conductor. <<|needle|>>In 1910 he became a contributing member of New York’s Clef Club, an organization of African-American musicians led by James Reese Europe. <<|needle|>>He served as chorus master and as assistant-conductor of the Club’s orchestra. <<|needle|>>Working with Reese Europe may have inspired the idea of forming the New York Syncopated Orchestra.\n\nOne of the SSO’s star performers was the legendary (and highly paid) New Orleans clarinettist Sidney Bechet. <<|needle|>>Having discovered a soprano saxophone in a shop in Wardour Street, Soho, he requested a double octave key to be added and soon dazzled audiences with the extra power this new instrument gave him. <<|needle|>>Bechet put the SSO and jazz on London’s musical map.\n\nAn orchestra with ever changing members and repertoire, the SSO performed a mixture of jazz, ragtime, spirituals, minstrel songs, and light classical music. <<|needle|>>The orchestra made a deep impression across Europe.\n\nThe band toured Britain between 1919 and 1921 and quickly became a staple on the London club circuit. <<|needle|>>They were invited by the Prince of Wales (future King Edward VIII) to perform at Buckingham Palace on August 19th, 1919. <<|needle|>>Some hundred guests joined the event which was held in a drained-out lake in the palace gardens.\n\nDuring their 1921 “Farewell Tour of Europe,” the orchestra completed three weeks in October at the Lyric Theatre, Glasgow. <<|needle|>>Its members left the city on Saturday night, October 8th, having boarded the SS Rowan bound for Ireland.\n\nThe SSO was scheduled to play a series of highly anticipated concerts at La Scala Theatre, just off Dublin’s O’Connell Street. <<|needle|>>Will Marion Cook had left the orchestra by that time.\n\nDeparture of the ship was delayed because of the late arrival of the band. <<|needle|>>In thick fog, whilst approaching Corsewall Point before sailing south into the Irish Sea, the Rowan was rammed by the American Glasgow-bound steamer West Camak. <<|needle|>>While passengers were in the process of leaving ship, she was hit again by the British Clan Malcolm. <<|needle|>>The Rowan was cut in two and sank quickly.\n\nThirty-six lives were lost in the disaster, including that of Captain Donald Brown. <<|needle|>>Eleven crew members and twenty-five passengers drowned. <<|needle|>>Many bodies were never recovered from the sea. <<|needle|>>Eight victims were members of the orchestra. <<|needle|>>Singer Frank Bates was one of those who went down with the ship. <<|needle|>>Pete Robinson’s body was found after the sinking. <<|needle|>>He was buried in an unmarked grave in London’s Tooting Cemetery.\n\nCaptain Brown was held responsible for the first collision for sailing too fast under dangerous conditions and failing to sound a whistle (under maritime law all ships are required to signal their presence with a foghorn).<image>The tragedy received widespread media coverage in Britain and beyond. <<|needle|>>On October 10th The Irish Times reported the sinking of the passenger ship. <<|needle|>>The paper mourned the loss of lives that included a “number of the members of a negro orchestra which was to have opened an engagement today in Dublin.” Milan’s newspaper La Domenica del Corriere published a full-page sensationalist image of the disaster produced by its long-standing illustrator Achille Beltrame.\n\nSurvivors of the calamity were brought back to Glasgow, where theaters staged relief concerts in aid of Southern Syncopated Orchestra members and help them replace their musical instruments, all of which had been lost. <<|needle|>>The ensemble quickly regrouped. <<|needle|>>After attending the funerals of their colleagues in London, its members traveled to Dublin. <<|needle|>>On October 17th, 1921, the orchestra opened at La Scala for the delayed two-week engagement to public acclaim, before going on to play venues in Derry and Belfast.\n\nThe Orchestra was disbanded in November 1921. <<|needle|>>No recordings of the group have ever been discovered and it is unlikely they ever recorded. <<|needle|>>Its legacy may now be largely forgotten, but following the Dublin concerts jazz became increasingly popular in Ireland. <<|needle|>>The SSO stirred a fierce response in traditionalist circles.When jazz became widespread in Europe in the aftermath of war, it elicited strong emotional reactions. <<|needle|>>Jazz, it was feared, was a music of uprooted peoples. <<|needle|>>It symbolized the ascendancy of an alien element in global culture.\n\nNegative emotions make for poor politics as they preclude rational judgement. <<|needle|>>In Europe, the hatred of jazz in certain circles and the rise of chauvinism overlapped. <<|needle|>>Ideologically motivated criticism of the new music was rampant in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. <<|needle|>>An additional aspect of jazz anxiety was the Jewish identity of many musicians (Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and others).\n\nThe battle over jazz was fought out in traditionalist Ireland. <<|needle|>>Founded in December 1922, the first decade of the Irish Free State coincided with the Jazz Age. <<|needle|>>The wireless and gramophone transported unfamiliar rhythms to every corner of rural Ireland. <<|needle|>>Returning immigrants brought records and sheet music back from London or New York. <<|needle|>>Jazz crossed all political, geographical, and linguistic boundaries.\n\nThe SSO was not the first African-American ensemble to visit Ireland. <<|needle|>>Philadelphia-born drummer Louis Mitchell and the Seven Spades band had toured British and Irish music halls from April to November 1917. <<|needle|>>Later in his illustrious career he would bill himself as the “first man to bring jazz to Britain.”\n\nEver since Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five recorded “Irish Black Bottom” in November 1926, everyone seemed hit by jazz fever: “All over Ireland / You can see the people dancin’ it / ‘Cause Ireland’s gone Black Bottom crazy.”\n\nParish priest Peter Conefrey was a zealous defender of Irish cultural traditions and a preserver of sexual morality. <<|needle|>>On New Year’s Day 1934, he led a demonstration of several thousand people along the main street of Mohill, County Leitrim, to inaugurate his Anti-Jazz campaign.\n\nBanners read “Down with Jazz” and “Out with Paganism.” Traditional pipe bands spurred the marchers on. <<|needle|>>In his speech Conefrey warned that jazz was “borrowed from the language of the savages in Africa, and its object is to destroy virtue in the human soul.”\n\nMoral guardians of religious values and cultural puritans of the Gaelic League despised jazz-inspired dancing above all. <<|needle|>>Unlicensed dance halls sprang up all over the country where unsupervised youngsters were let loose to experience music’s all-disturbing power of sensuality. <<|needle|>>The “Devil’s Music” lured them towards depths of depravity.\n\nA dreaded source of ruin amongst traditionalists, jazz had a younger and more open generation stomping for joy. <<|needle|>>Music creates controversy. <<|needle|>>It does not eradicate prejudice; it simply outlives it as moral crusaders come and go and disappear into oblivion (who remembers Father Peter Conefrey?).\n\nIllustrations, from above: the only surviving photograph of the entire ensemble taken outside Brighton Dome in August 1921;

than 200 friends of the Wilson Museum gathered on the lawn at the Perkins Street campus to fete retiring Executive Director Patricia “Patty” L. <<|needle|>>Hutchins. <<|needle|>>She has been a presence at the museum for nearly 50 years. <<|needle|>>It was evident from the outpouring of praise that she and the museum have made quite an impact on the community in that time.\n\nPlenty of food and drink was available while a program of speakers took to the podium. <<|needle|>>Afterwards, there were several special demonstrations of living history, one of Hutchins’ favorite aspects of the museum.\n\nShe spoke first, graciously thanking the museum board, a host of local organizations and businesses, most of which were represented, and her own family, including a great-grandchild, many of whom were present for the festivities. <<|needle|>>“It has been a great privilege to serve this community,” she said.\n\nShe also told stories of trying to lure people to the museum with food. <<|needle|>>“Sometimes I’d stand in front of their cars with a plate of cookies,” she joked.\n\nFood has been an abiding presence at the museum during Hutchins’ tenure. <<|needle|>>The picnic was her idea, according to the president of the Board of Trustees, Temple Blackwood. <<|needle|>>It featured beans baked in a bean hole and bread baked in the wood-fired bake oven, one of Hutchins’ personal specialties.\n\nThere was even a raffle of wooden bowls, turned by expert woodworker Blackwood for the event. <<|needle|>>According to Haley Blake, the education coordinator at the museum, the bowls were specially designed to fit the loaves of bread that Hutchins makes in the bake oven.\n\nHutchins was also presented with a life-size image of herself in period garb beside a cook fire. <<|needle|>>The photo was by photographer Rosemary Wyman.\n\nBlackwood was joined at the podium by longtime member of the Castine selectboard, Peter Vogell, and Castine Town Manager Shawn Blodgett. <<|needle|>>Together they presented Hutchins with a plaque to mark her 50 years of service to the community and the museum.\n\nHutchins’ husband of 57 years, Sherm, who is also a member of the state legislature, read from an official document of the 130th Legislature recognizing his wife’s life’s work.\n\nSuch proclamations are made to recognize significant achievements, he explained. <<|needle|>>For example, the valedictorian of the University of Maine got one recently, too.\n\n“At my house, my wife is valedictorian. <<|needle|>>That’s not so bad because that makes me salutatorian—unless someone is visiting,” said Sherm.\n\nHans Carlson of the museum board announced that the board has created a special position for Hutchins, Executive Director Emeritus, that will keep her around the museum even after she hands over the reins.\n\nThe official date for new Executive Director Julia Gray to take over is September 11, the date of the board’s annual meeting.\n\nKay Hightower of the museum board announced the creation of the Patricia Hutchins Endowed Intern Fund. <<|needle|>>She thanked the donors who helped to raise $100,000, which “we will continue to grow,” she said.\n\nHutchins has been involved at the museum since the 1970s, getting her start by making costumes to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the museum.\n\nThen directed by Ellenore Doudiet, the founder’s daughter, the Wilson Museum, under Hutchins’ leadership, has transitioned into a public nonprofit organization with a substantial endowment run by a Board of Trustees.\n\nThe institution has grown from a single building housing the geological, archeological and anthropological collections of Dr. <<|needle|>>John Howard Wilson to the multi-building campus it is today. <<|needle|>>It even features a modern meeting room with, appropriately, a kitchen, in the Hutchins Education Center, named to honor four generations of Hutchins family service to the museum.\n\nPatty and her husband Sherm have both been running the museum’s operations for a long time, taking over from Sherm’s parents before them.\n\nCoincidentally, 2021 marks the 100th anniversary of the museum’s founding.Sherm

<<|needle|>>26, ranks among Judaism’s most joyous holidays.\n\nIn synagogues, Jews read the Scroll of Esther, a book in the Hebrew Bible that explains how Purim came to be. <<|needle|>>Jewish people dress up in costumes and host carnivals. <<|needle|>>At home, they indulge in festive dinners with ample wine. <<|needle|>>It’s a time of togetherness. <<|needle|>>Jews deliver treats to one another and make sure to provide charity for their most needy.\n\nAs a historian of American Judaism, I point to Purim as an important holiday that did much to increase Jews’ visibility in the United States in the 19th century.\n\nDuring that period, Purim put a social spotlight on New York’s Jews and their up-and-coming relationship to the city’s most elite class.\n\nThe story of Purim\n\nPurim tells the tale of Esther, an orphaned girl-turned-queen, how she married King Achashverosh, then saved the entire Jewish community in the ancient Persian city of Shushan, through her bravery and wit.\n\nMordecai was also Esther’s uncle, a fact unknown to Achashverosh, so that Esther’s Jewish identity could remain concealed. <<|needle|>>When Queen Esther learns about Haman’s plan, she risks her life and discloses her Jewishness to her husband. <<|needle|>>The king sides with his bride over his doomed advisor. <<|needle|>>Purim became a celebration of the victory of Shushan’s Jews over the evil Haman.\n\nThe Purim story resonates with today’s American Jews. <<|needle|>>It’s packed with contemporary themes such as charges of dual loyalty, that Jews cannot be trusted as Americans when they remain tied to Israel. <<|needle|>>With many Jews marrying outside of their religion, Purim rings relevant on the issue of intermarriage as well.\n\nYet, Esther’s tale was perhaps less useful in the 19th century when America’s Jews were not so visible and they weren’t as concerned about assimilation. <<|needle|>>When a group of New York Jewish socialites invented the Purim Ball in the 1860s, their intention was to downplay Purim’s Persian legend.\n\nTheir goal was to be the same, not different. <<|needle|>>They wanted to be counted in Manhattan’s upper crust.\n\nThe start of a fancy Purim Ball\n\nIn January 1860, Myer Isaacs, a lawyer and political activist, issued a proposal in the pages of the Jewish Messenger, a weekly published in his native New York by his father, Samuel Myer Isaacs. <<|needle|>>The younger Isaacs suggested “Purim night should be selected as the occasion of a good fancy dress ball, the proceeds to be devoted to charity.”\n\nIsaacs’s assumptions about the linkage between a classy event and fundraising was typical of the “charity market” among Victorian Era elites. <<|needle|>>Philanthropy was an exchange: The donor obtained an “experience” — musical concerts, theater, for example — for his or her generous contribution.\n\nIt was a period when charity provided the affluent with an opportunity to solidify their place atop the social ladder.\n\nPurim was an ideal candidate for this sort of ritual enhancement for New York’s Jewish elite. <<|needle|>>One of its traditions was charity-giving; the Purim Ball over time would become a reliable source of income for the Jewish orphanages and welfare societies in New York.The Feast of Purim – Reception at the Home for Aged and Infirm Jews, at No. <<|needle|>>328 West 32nd Street. <<|needle|>>(Image © Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nNo one was quick to pick up on Isaacs’s recommendation, however. <<|needle|>>Isaacs tried again the following year, always in the pages of his father’s newspaper.\n\nIn 1862, he took more concrete steps. <<|needle|>>The 20-year-old gathered a small group of first-generation American Jews with aspirations to appear on a routine basis in the New York society columns. <<|needle|>>They organized the first Purim ball at Irving Hall, a prominent theater space in Manhattan, decorating the space with ornaments and plenty of pageantry such as entertainment and plays.\n\nNew York statute forbade masquerades, so Isaacs and his friends publicized it to wealthy New Yorkers as a “Fancy Dress Ball.” The guests, Jews and non-Jews, intuited the meaning and appeared dressed as Little Red Riding Hood and Shakespearean figures such as Romeo and Hamlet. <<|needle|>>Even though it was a Purim event, there was no mention that anyone was expected to dress up as Queen Esther.\n\nThe affair was very well received by attendees, compelling Isaacs to formalize the Purim Association of the City of New York to help ensure the newfound tradition persisted.\n\nThe Purim Ball straddled the line between a Jewish ritual and a New York society event. <<|needle|>>Yet, it hewed in the direction of the latter, attracting the leading women and men of New York. <<|needle|>>The mayor, police chief and leading figures of Tammany Hall frequented the balls. <<|needle|>>The Purim Association did not hold the gala on the actual date of Purim — usually it was held the day after or in the subsequent week — allowing New York’s Jews to observe Purim with its more traditional and less extravagant trappings.\n\nThe Purim Ball’s second installment was upgraded to the grander and more capacious Academy of Music. <<|needle|>>Its organizers distributed 800 invitations, which turned out to be quite insufficient. <<|needle|>>In all, 3,000 women and men attended the ball in March 1863. <<|needle|>>A report published in the New York Times declared that a “more brilliant affair has never been witnessed at the Academy.”\n\nThe Times article stated, “Very many exquisite evening toilettes set off the charms of the black-eyed belles in the boxes, and the universal masculine verdict is, that so many pretty faces have never before been seen at any one occasion, within the walls of the Academy.”The masquerade theme might have fit into Purim tradition, but Isaacs intended for it to accommodate all New Yorkers. <<|needle|>>As Isaac then wrote in the Jewish Messenger, he wanted it to “come off in such a way as to justify the suggestion that all New York is celebrating Purim.”\n\nThe favorable reviews were sufficient for Isaacs to declare that the Purim Ball had emerged, by its second iteration, as a Manhattan “institution,” an affair “naturalized in New York.”\n\nThe archives at the American Jewish Historical Society reveal that the top-priced seating boxes went to couples with Jewish surnames such as Seligman, Rosenwald, Schiff and Guggenheim. <<|needle|>>The Purim Association spared no expense on the music.\n\nNew York socialites and leading politicians continued to gravitate to the event, looking forward to the Purim Ball. <<|needle|>>Tickets for the event, sold at auction, did not last long on the open market, especially the preferred theater boxes.\n\nBy the 1890s, the Purim Association rented a larger space in Madison Square Garden and held bidding for the choicest seats in the vestry room of one of New York’s most well-heeled synagogue, Temple Emanu-El.\n\nThe success of New York’s Purim Ball inspired others to organize similar events. <<|needle|>>By the 1880s, it was replicated in dozens of communities.\n\nSt. <<|needle|>>Louis’s Jews were very proud of their “well-regulated” masquerade ball which, they claimed was “one of the most enjoyable affairs in the society world.”\n\nIn 1891, the Purim program held in Philadelphia, much influenced by a local aristocratic spirit, was fashioned more like a debutante ball, a coming-of-age event for upper-class young ladies.\n\nThe Purim Ball, then, was a cultural transaction. <<|needle|>>Jews believed it led them to acquire status and America obtained a curious and swanky incarnation of Purim, in New York and beyond.\n\n(Zev Eleff,

Well, I have confirmed the quote from the December 23, 1940 Time Magazine Vault, and it does indeed quote Albert Einstein as saying:\n\n\"Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. <<|needle|>>I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom. <<|needle|>>I am forced thus to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly.\"”My position concerning God is that of an agnostic. <<|needle|>>I am convinced that a vivid consciousness of the primary importance of moral principles for the betterment and ennoblement of life does not need the idea of a law-giver, especially a law-giver who works on the basis of reward and punishment.” (Albert Einstein in a letter to M. <<|needle|>>Berkowitz, October 25, 1950; Einstein Archive 59–215; from Alice Calaprice, ed., The New Quotable Einstein, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2005, p. <<|needle|>>206. <<|needle|>>)I wish to thank \"Short Little Rebel\" from where I gleaned most of the above quotes.Why do Catholics, and others, observe the Season of Lent?\n\nIt is for multiple reasons, here are a few:\n1) Jesus spent 40 days and 40 nights in fasting and prayer in the desert before he began His public ministry.\n2) It is a time for us to call into remembrance what Jesus did for us, especially His Passion, Death and Resurrection.\n3) For many, it is a time of spiritual renewal - a \"recharge\" every year to help us keep Jesus Christ in the forefront of our thoughts and actions throughout the year - not just during Lent.\n\n\nWhy do we \"give up something\" for Lent?\n\nIn some small way, what we \"give up\" is a small sacrifice by which we unite ourselves to the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross. <<|needle|>>Whenever we would have partaken in that which we have \"given up\" we draw our thoughts to Christ. <<|needle|>>Therefore what we \"give up\" should be something we would have partaken in every day, or even multiple times per day. <<|needle|>>For example, giving up eggs for Lent (this is part of what the Orthodox traditionally do), when you would have had eggs for breakfast - while you're partaking in the alternative, you recall WHY you're not eating eggs. <<|needle|>>One could offer up coffee, or soda, or chocolate, fast-food, red meat or even all meat - whatever it is you have \"given up,\" if you remain faithful to it - becomes another realization of celebration at the end of Lent.\n\nAgain, still practiced by the Orthodox, giving up eggs was part of the Lenten penance, however - chickens don't stop laying eggs for Lent! So, rather than waste the eggs - boil them!  They last a bit longer when boiled. <<|needle|>>Coloring the eggs too made them \"special\" and then on Easter Sunday, you got a special treat of eating eggs again!The Taking of Deborah LoganTomatoes grow faster than cucumbers.<image>Ok...in a nutshell. <<|needle|>>This film does what many...MANY others have tried to do in the past. <<|needle|>>There are many elements we've seen before.\nFaux documentary style footage. <<|needle|>>Cameras mounted on walls that we see footage from. <<|needle|>>Hand held camera footage with people running about and shouting things. <<|needle|>>BUT....The Taking of Deborah Logan does it all a lot better than many of the films I've seen of late.\n\nThe factors? More real world applications of the above and a better execution. <<|needle|>>The acting backs it all up as well. <<|needle|>>So, we have many of the same elements with a feel that makes it seem far more realistic than some of the other docu-footage films I've sat through and been sad about once they are done.Example? Towards the end of this film I stood up, moved towards the TV and  folded my arms in front of my chest staring intently at the images on the screen.Lettuce grows slower than cucumbers. <<|needle|>>Then at one point I said, \"Wait....WHAAAAT?! Holy CRAP!\" out loud at the TV.\n\nAt another point I said, \"Oh....fuck YOU guys!\" and laughed because the filmmakers TOTALLY got me with a jumper. <<|needle|>>And, at yet another point I physically backed away from my screen a few inches and groaned, \"Oh man...that's messed up.\"\n\nThe film is friggin creepy. <<|needle|>>It has a fantastic \"spine\" to build off of story wise and it makes use of every once and inch of it. <<|needle|>>Simple setup - a documentary crew is on site to film Deborah Logan as she fights Alzheimer's with her daughter in the family home. <<|needle|>>When Deborah takes a quick and unexpected turn for the worse, things get interesting. <<|needle|>>Nuff said.\n\nAnd the acting. <<|needle|>>Holy crap.\n\nJill Larson turns in a frigging wondrous performance as Deborah. <<|needle|>>Riveting. <<|needle|>>Anne Ramsay plays her daughter, Sarah, and she is equally grand. <<|needle|>>Very believable and super solid performances that I never scoffed at. <<|needle|>>The rest of the cast was fab as well, though I have to say they were overshadowed by the performances of Larson and Ramsay. <<|needle|>>You know what they didn't do? They didn't fail the film and that's huge. <<|needle|>>In some of these films, the acting of a few misplaced folks completely KILL the film - ripping the viewer away from their involvement in the story into a realm of tearing their acting apart and bemoaning their presence. <<|needle|>> Everyone felt \"real\" here and that was huge. <<|needle|>>Great casting all around.And....Adam Robitel. <<|needle|>>Bravo, man. <<|needle|>>REALLY nice work. <<|needle|>> Really knocked it out of the park with this one. <<|needle|>>There's a great interview with him on THE INSIDERS, but you should listen to it after watching the film. <<|needle|>> He's a smart guy that is bound to do, more grand things in the future.\n\nMan...I really enjoyed this film. <<|needle|>>Is it for everyone? No. <<|needle|>>In this internet anonymous world we live in, I'm sure people will bash SOMETHING about this film.\n\n\"There's too much TAAAAAAlking....\"  Whaa...quiet. <<|needle|>>I'm trying to listen to actual plot and character driven story. <<|needle|>>Go play with your CGI ghosts and silly jump-scares somewhere else. <<|needle|>>:)\n\n\"They are just doing stuff like Paranormal Activity.\"   Whaa...so are thousands of others, but the difference is these guys are kicking arse at it like Oren Peli did with the original.Check out The Taking of Deborah Logan at once!\n\nCurrently available on NETFLIX, AMAZON and iTunes at the time of this posting.9 cars to be launched during festive season\n\nThe Indian car market is going to see a spike in sales as the festive season rolls in and car manufacturers are all set to cash in on the festive rush. <<|needle|>>Here we take a look at the cars that will be launched this festive season and when they are expected to launch.(Photo courtesy:  Team BHP)\nThe upcoming Manza Club Class gets cosmetic changes along with some new features.Cucumbers grow faster than lettuce but slower than tomatoes. <<|needle|>>The base model is expected to get an engine change as well. <<|needle|>>This will be a 74 bhp Quadrajet engine for the LS variant replacing the present 89 Bhp engine.\n\nThe new features expected on the Manza Club Class include touch screen multimedia navigation, automatic climate control, Italian leather upholstery, different coloured roof (like the Vista), and new 8 spoke alloy wheels. <<|needle|>>The base LS will get fresh chrome inserts and a new engine, the LX will also get fresh chrome inserts along with electric HVAC. <<|needle|>>Read more: Tata Manza Club Class to launch on October 3Ford will launch the face-lifted Figo small car on October 15. <<|needle|>>The Front of the new Figo sports a hexagonal front grille and air dam similar to the Fiesta Sedan. <<|needle|>>The front bumper and headlamp have been refreshed as well. <<|needle|>>It will also sport a new reflector design with the indicators at the bottom of the headlamp casing unlike the older design.\n\nThere will be no changes to the engine of the Figo and the changes will be purely cosmetic. <<|needle|>>Read more: Ford Figo Facelift spotted without camouflage!The Maruti Alto 800 will be launched on October 16 and will be the cheapest car from Maruti’s stables. <<|needle|>>It is expected to be priced between Rs. <<|needle|>>2 to Rs. <<|needle|>>3 lakh. <<|needle|>>Such a price for a Maruti Suzuki car could rope in high sales numbers.\n\nIt will be powered by an 800cc, F8D engine (also used in the current Alto Standard). <<|needle|>>However the engine will make 3 bhp more power than the present Alto which makes 44 bhp of power. <<|needle|>>It will also have better torque and has an ARAI certified mileage of 22 kmpl.<image>It is also powered by the same 2.2-litre DiCOR motor that powers the present model but puts out 140 bhp of power and 320 Nm of torque. <<|needle|>>It uses the Tata Aria’s hydro formed body-on-ladder chassis which will give it a better ride quality and handling than the current model.Mahindra will launch the Ssangyong Rexton SUV on October 17. <<|needle|>>The Rexton is a luxury seven-seater that is powered by a 2.7 litre diesel engine that makes 180 bhp of power and more than 400 Nm of torque. <<|needle|>>The Rexton will compete with the Chevrolet Captiva, Toyota Fortuner and Ford Endeavour. <<|needle|>>When launched, expect the Rexton to be priced at about Rs. <<|needle|>>20 lakh. <<|needle|>>Also read: Mahindra Rexton launch on October 17Honda will launch the Brio AT on October 18 and CarToq has already previewed this vehicle!

In this article, open source community members share what they like (or don't like) in a sticker, their \"rules\" for collecting and displaying them, and their sticker wish lists.\n\nSkip ahead to the sticky parts:The first time I ordered open source-related stickers was after attending LinuxFest Northwest in 2009. <<|needle|>>A young girl attending the event with her father chatted with me at the Linux Pro Magazine booth and suggested that we hand out stickers. <<|needle|>>Although I'd been working in tech publishing for more than a decade by the time a 12-year-old called me out for not having stickers, I hadn't given stickers much thought, and I hadn't recognized the roles they play in open source culture.\n\nAs I recall, the Linux Pro Magazine stickers I ordered were 5 inches wide and 3 inches tall. <<|needle|>>Occasionally someone would request that I order smaller stickers, but I liked that I could see our stickers on a speaker's laptop from across a conference room. <<|needle|>>And I was happy with the service and quality I got from Sticker Giant. <<|needle|>>That was a lucky break—I knew bands that ordered stickers from there, otherwise I wouldn't have known where to start. <<|needle|>>I'm pretty sure that the Fedora sticker I picked up at a conference a few years ago and accidentally left in a pocket when I did laundry was from the same vendor, and that thing stuck to the inside of my dryer—without fading—for at least two years. <<|needle|>>(For all I know, it's still in a dryer back in Kansas.)\n\nI won't cover which vendors to use when ordering stickers, but feel free to make your recommendations in the comments. <<|needle|>>Instead, let's look a little closer at what open source community members want in a sticker, why they like them, and how they are used, which is helpful information when you think about design and what shapes, sizes, and quantities to order.\n\n\"I am in a company that is new to OS [open source] and I always get the question, 'Why do you have all these stickers?'\" says Nithya Ruff, Head of the Open Source Strategy Office at SanDisk. <<|needle|>>Nithya says that, to some people, the stickers look unprofessional, and when she worked at a previous company, she was told that they took away from her professional gravitas. <<|needle|>>\"I now explain that I am a member of the open source community,\" she says, \"And as such, this is how we show affiliation and respect, and I am proud to do it.\"\"I love a sticker that identifies itself as open source, or being for Linux, or similar,\" says Opensource.com community moderator Seth Kenlon. <<|needle|>>\"I would rather people see and understand, at least on some level, that I walk around with 30 stickers on my computer because I'm supporting real people, not just because I am selling my soul to every company that hands me a sticker.\"Like other people in open source, Nithya and Seth have their own sets of rules for which stickers make the cut and get stuck on the limited real estate of a laptop. <<|needle|>>There are the personal stickers, like the ones from the schools Nithya attended and her kids attend. <<|needle|>>And then there are the open source culture and more practical rules.\n\nIn the unofficial Rules of Sticker Club, stickers must do one or more of the following:\n\nNithya's laptop includes stickers from foundations Sandisk belongs to and projects they support, such as Ceph, OpenStack, and the Linux Foundation. <<|needle|>>She also likes stickers that show support for women in tech, such as Ada Initiative, PyLadies, and Girl Develop It (GDI).\n\n\"I only add stickers to my laptop if I am somehow connected (support/use) to the project behind the sticker,\" says Opensource.com community moderator Nitish Tiwari. <<|needle|>>\"I recently removed all the stickers from my laptop just because I was bored, but generally I find stickers a good way to show support toward a cause/organization.\"\n\nFor Seth, stickers are about the open source projects and the people. <<|needle|>>\"I am not interested in advertising for companies,\" he says. <<|needle|>>\"In fact, I frequently use stickers to conceal what brand of computer I have, because if I'm going to be a walking billboard for anything in this crazy brand-crazed world, it's going to be for projects by my friends, who don't have the money to brainwash people with TV ads, but actually do want people to know about and use their software (or listen to their music, or whatever).\"\n\nBrian Flannery, Alliances and Ecosystem at NATS.io, says that open source communities are first and foremost about people. <<|needle|>>\"While all of the organizations represented on my laptop are extremely innovative, the people are really important, and my interactions with them is what I most remember and attribute to a particular sticker,\" he says.\"I like stickers that I've 'earned',\" says Opensource.com community moderator Ben Cotton, \"So my favorite is probably my SysAdvent contributor sticker. <<|needle|>>It's a nice reminder that I did something to give back to the community.\"\n\nNitish says that stickers he received after contributing to a project or organization—including ones from Taiga, Opensource.com, and Gibbon—are his favorites.\n\nIf you like traveling a lot, and don't like collecting desk clutter, think of stickers as the snow globes of tech events. <<|needle|>>They are a nice little lightweight memento to take home from work-related travel. <<|needle|>>In addition to collecting stickers from projects he uses and advocates for, Ben Nuttall, education developer advocate for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, likes stickers from conferences he has attended. <<|needle|>>\"I don't mind stickers overlapping, but I try not to cover up too much of any,\" he says.Like Ben, I'm also a fan of conference stickers, but when you travel often, you quickly run out of room on a laptop. <<|needle|>>That's why the side of my home desk and my suitcase are speckled with stickers now, too.\n\n\"My favourite stickers tend to be either Slackware or FSF stickers, because those are two projects that I care about, but they also use iconography that is slightly more obscure than a lot of other projects,\" Seth says. <<|needle|>>\"I mean, anyone can draw a cute squirrel as their logo, but only the FSF uses a not-particularly cute wildebeest. <<|needle|>>I guess I tend to like 'ugly' stickers more than non-ugly stickers. <<|needle|>>But there are exceptions.\"\n\n\"I love the NASA and Astro Pi ones—because who doesn't love space?\" Ben Nuttall says. <<|needle|>>\"'There is no cloud, only other people's computers' is a great phrase on the Free Software Foundation Europe sticker.\"\n\nNithya loves the popular GitHub stickers. <<|needle|>>\"They are always so creative,\" she says.\n\nThe only exception Seth has to his rule about stickers showing support for open source projects or people is when he uses vendor stickers for a practical purpose, like when he put an AMD sticker on his tower. <<|needle|>>\"But that's not because I'm proud of the part,\" he explains. <<|needle|>>\"It's purely to help me track what computer is using what, or what kind of repairs any given computer has had done.\"Opensource.com community moderator David Both doesn't put many stickers on his laptop because he's careful about heat. <<|needle|>>\"Heat is the worst enemy of electronic circuitry, including laptop displays,\" David says. <<|needle|>>\"Stickers are insulators and prevent the proper dissipation of heat. <<|needle|>>So I have only a few and try to leave plenty of un-stickered real estate on the back of my display.\"\n\nYou can have a lot of stickers, but you can't have them all. <<|needle|>>For example, I'd like a replacement sticker for the one from Google that's stuck to my old MacBook Pro, which says, \"I'm a woman in tech. <<|needle|>>That doesn't mean everything has to be pink.\" Like me, the people I interviewed for this story have a sticker wishlist.\n\nSeth says he wants more Slackware stickers. <<|needle|>>\"I'd love a Slax sticker, because I use Slax all the time but have never seen a sticker for it,\" he says. <<|needle|>>He's also got Kdenlive and Urxvt on the list. <<|needle|>>\"Some kind of UTF-8/Unicode awareness sticker would be cool,\" he adds.\n\nNithya is on the lookout for Docker and Android stickers, and another one from Ceph.\n\n\"I would like to collect stickers of all the famous Linux distros,\" Nitish says. <<|needle|>>\"Right now I only have Ubuntu.\"\n\n\"There are some great GitHub Octodex stickers,\" Ben Nuttall says. <<|needle|>>\"I have a couple, but there are a few I really wish I had, like the Adventure Time and Portal.\"\n\n\"I don't have any OSI or Software Freedom Conservancy stickers,\" Ben Cotton says. <<|needle|>>\"I assume they exist somewhere.\"\n\nHow many stickers are on your laptop? I've got two inside by my keyboard (Fedora and Opensource.com), and 20 on the cover. <<|needle|>>(Take our poll.)Now that we have a better idea of what people like in their stickers, why, and how they use them, we can create a list of sticker tips for open source projects and events:\n\nWhat did I leave out of the list of sticker tips for open source projects and events? What are the missing Rules for Sticker Club? Let me know about them in the comments, or tweet your feedback with the hashtag #openstickers.\n\nLet's see your laptop sticker showcase. <<|needle|>>Share your sticker photos with us on Twitter using the hashtag #openstickers.\n\nThank you to everyone who contributed to this story, and especially to that girl who told me I needed to order stickers years ago at LinuxFest Northwest.\"This is my

next\nRikki EndsleyIt is easy to experience various physical and mental problems during pregnancy, such as morning sickness in early pregnancy and changes in hormone balance. <<|needle|>>With these changes, you may get tired or get stressed during pregnancy.\n\nHere is some advice on how to deal with stress during pregnancy and how to relieve it.\n\nHow Does Stress During Pregnancy Affect The Fetus?Although stress during pregnancy is inevitable, too much stress can have a negative impact on the baby.\n\nNot only does stress pose a risk of impending premature birth and pregnancy hypertension, but it has also been reported that the children of mothers who had high levels of anxiety and stress during pregnancy are more likely to be emotionally unstable.\n\nWhy Do I Feel Stressed When Pregnant?Pregnancy is a very short time in our lives. <<|needle|>>During this precious time, it is best to spend it peacefully and enjoy the growth of your baby if you can.\n\nHowever, there are many mothers who feel stressed during pregnancy, and many of them cannot control their emotions well and end up complaining to the people around them.\n\nHowever, it is believed that progesterone suppresses the secretion of a brain transmitter called serotonin, which calms the mind. <<|needle|>>Therefore, during pregnancy, when progesterone is secreted in large amounts, even the slightest thing can cause irritation.\n\nChronic sleep deprivation not only causes a great deal of stress but also disturbs the balance of the autonomic nervous system. <<|needle|>>As a result, you will often feel depressed over small things, or conversely, irritated over things that would not normally bother you.\n\nThis can lead to a vicious cycle of stress, which further disturbs the autonomic nerve balance …\n\nCauses of Stress During PregnancyPregnancy can be a stressful time, but it can also be compounded by a number of anxieties and worries that contribute to stress.\n\nWhether you are pregnant for the first time or for the second or subsequent time, you are bound to feel some anxiety or worry about childbirth and childcare.\n\nAccording to a survey of 890 pregnant women conducted by the Women’s Labor Association in 2006, the causes and degree of stress differed greatly depending on whether they were working or not during pregnancy.\n\nCauses of Stress in Pregnant Women Who WorkWith the number of dual-earner households now exceeding half, the number of women who work during pregnancy is increasing. <<|needle|>>The most common cause of stress for these pregnant women is anxiety about returning to work after maternity leave and balancing work with child-rearing.\n\nFinancial concerns during maternity leave and concern for co-workers also ranked high, with more than 80% of respondents feeling stressed by the anxiety that comes with working.\n\nIn addition, 60-70% of pregnant women feel anxiety about morning sickness and other health problems, childbirth, and childcare, and they are simultaneously dealing with anxiety related to work and stress related to pregnancy and childbirth itself.\n\nCauses of stress in pregnant women who are housewives\n\nPregnant women who do not work are more likely to feel stressed by anxiety and worries related to pregnancy and childbirth itself because they do not have work-related stress.\n\nIn particular, as many as 80% of mothers feel stressed about “anxiety about morning sickness and other physical changes,” and anxiety about childbirth and childcare, as well as about the condition of their babies, is also greater than that of pregnant women who are working.\n\nStress on partners is a common factor\n\nIn a research survey of 573 pregnant women, the most common cause of stress was reported to be the husband.\n\nIt seems that the lack of understanding and cooperation of the partner towards the pregnancy often causes stress, but since men are not carrying the baby in their bellies, it may be understandable that they do not really understand the hardships of pregnant women.\n\nThere are also women who find their partners physiologically unacceptable and become irritated by their very existence.\n\nIn such cases, try to get away from your partner, even if it is only for a moment, by making time to be alone in the house or leaving the housework to someone else and going out. <<|needle|>>You will feel refreshed and your frustration will subside somewhat.\n\nHow to Deal with Stress During PregnancyEven though it is inevitable that you will feel stressed during pregnancy, you want to welcome your baby with a sense of calm if possible. <<|needle|>>If you have an older child, it is possible that emotional development could be affected if the mother is constantly stressed and irritable.\n\nWhile it is impossible to completely prevent stress caused by hormonal imbalance and poor health during pregnancy, it is possible to reduce the chances of feeling stressed by eliminating some of the causes that contribute to stress.\n\nIt is important for pregnant women who are working not to “overthink”.\n\nOf course, it is important that you do not want to burden your workplace with your pregnancy and childbirth. <<|needle|>>However, trying to do everything perfectly can lead to a great deal of stress.\n\nMany women are worried about life after maternity leave, but it is not a good idea to start thinking about it too much during pregnancy. <<|needle|>>Don’t think too much about your life afterward while you are pregnant, but think about giving birth safely first, while creating an environment where you can balance work and childcare with your partner and family.\n\nThoughts on Balancing Childcare and Work"}
{"text": "I was six years old when the real ‘Battle of The Sexes’ tennis match happened so I do not have much recollection of it. <<|needle|>>So I went into this movie not really knowing a lot of the ‘back story’ behind the historic tennis match between Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King. <<|needle|>>Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, ‘Battle Of The Sexes’ is pretty much a straightforward retelling of what happened before the match, with a lot of rom-com thrown in, on Billie’s side anyway.\n\nI did not mind the movie, and have to admit that I was taken along its sweeping journey (I truly did not know who won) and I look at this film kind of like a snapshot of a time. <<|needle|>>It’s 1973, and women’s rights are just starting to be bandied about, and of course, gay rights are still a lifetime away. <<|needle|>>I looked at it as an interesting story commenting of how things were back then, more than three decades ago. <<|needle|>>This has great performances from both Emma Stone and Steve Carrell (playing Billie and Bobby) and you can marvel at both.\n\nI wish it stayed with me, though. <<|needle|>>I saw it, and I kind of forgot about it right away. <<|needle|>>While essential, it did seem that the story seem dated, and a lot of what they were fighting for before is no more. <<|needle|>>But am I just being complacent? Now more than ever, these rights are slowly being taken away by the Trump administration. <<|needle|>>I just wish the movie inspired me more, it just all seemed so bland and vanilla.I will always be fascinated with movies about Wall Street because I used to work in the industry (and will probably even go back at some point) and I was excited to hear about “The Big Short,” which is based on Michael Lewis fascinating non-fiction book. <<|needle|>>Do we need another film about the housing market crash of 2008? There’s the excellent “Margin Call,” which explained Lehman Brother’s collapse, and earlier this year, 99 Homes (my thoughts here,  ) dealt with a more personal look at the homeowners which caused it.\n\nAdam McKay (he directed the Anchorman movies with Will Ferrell) starts off with a comic approach, drawing\n\ncharacters as almost cartoon-like characters – the metal head broker who wore flip flops, the neurotic New Yorker trader, zany investing BFFs – but, as things get more serious, we see these characters as more humanized versions of themselves. <<|needle|>>It all works great, thanks to great ensemble-piece acting by Christian Bale, Steve Carrell, and Finn Witrock, among others. <<|needle|>>I know and recognize these characters, based on my years of working in the industry. <<|needle|>>I have to make special mention of Brad Pitt, who lost himself in his character that I did not even realize it was him until after a couple of scenes. <<|needle|>>And I was pleasantly surprised by Ryan Gosling, who is fine here. <<|needle|>>(I have almost given up on him)All in all, the film succeeds. <<|needle|>>It gives us a reason to root for the “good guys” her, though we ask ourselves if we should be rooting for these people who basically bet against the US economy. <<|needle|>>And it explains how it all happened to most folks who normally who would not take the time to understand how it did, and did it in a very entertaining manner.The major cyber attack rounds off a sorry year for the iconic ferry and cruise company.\n\nLate on Monday morning, Norway's Hurtigruten announced it was the victim of a major IT hack. <<|needle|>>The ransomware attack has impacted several major systems.\n\n“This is a serious attack. <<|needle|>>Hurtigruten's global IT infrastructure seems to be affected,” said Ole-Marius Moe-Helgesen, Hurtigruten's executive Vice President for IT, in a statement. <<|needle|>>He said the company is now working to limit the damage.\n\nThe news comes just a few months after the Norwegian parliament was hit by an IT attack.\n\nWhat we know so far about the Hurtigruten cyber attack\n\nSeveral systems, including the Norwegian website hurtigruten.no and internal e-mail systems, are down. <<|needle|>>The company says the problems have likely been caused by a ransomware virus.“Our main priority now is to ensure safe and good

this statement, Hurtigruten has declined to comment further. <<|needle|>>NRK has contacted Nasjonal sikkerhetsmyndighet (the National Security Authority), the national body responsible for alerts and coordination relating to ICT security incidents. <<|needle|>>The authority stated they knew of the case, but would not comment further.\n\nSuch ransomware attacks have declined recently, but they do still happen. <<|needle|>>The Norwegian Centre for Information Security's Trude Talberg-Furulund told NRK that it's important to detect such attacks as early as possible.IT hack rounds off a sorry year for Hurtigruten\n\nAs with virtually every other travel company around the world, Hurtigruten has been hit hard by the global health crisis.\n\nAlthough facing a new competitor from next year, the company has long been famous for its daily coastal voyage, which serves dual purpose as a ferry service for goods and local people, and a coastal cruise for international tourists.\n\nBut aside from a couple ships used to deliver cargo and medical supplies to small communities in northern Norway on behalf of the Norwegian government, the entire Hurtigruten fleet was out of service for more than two months earlier this year.\n\nThe company was then hit by an outbreak one of the first sailings following the travel ban. <<|needle|>>Many passengers and crew of the MS Roald Amundsen were infected on a short cruise to Svalbard. <<|needle|>>The company received a fierce backlash from politicians and Norwegian media over its handling of the situation.The coastal service in 2021\n\nNew rival Havila was set to enter the Bergen-Kirkenes-Bergen market in 2021. <<|needle|>>But due to the current travel situation, the Norwegian government has announced that five Hurtigruten vessels will serve the route in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThis means there will be a Hurtigruten ship calling at ports approximately every other day.\n\n“2020 has been a tough year for everyone who uses the coastal route. <<|needle|>>I have a great understanding of business and passengers along the coast who have suffered from the limited service. <<|needle|>>Therefore, it is gratifying that we now have an offer in place that ensures calls almost every other day on the entire coastal route,” said Norway's transport minister Knut Arild Hareide.\n1st Law of Motion\nThe Concept of Inertia\nExplain the concept of inertia\nInertia is the tendency of a body at rest to resist motion when forced to move and a body in motion to continue moving when abruptly stopped.A good example is a passenger sitting on a seat in a bus at rest. <<|needle|>>When the bus starts moving the passenger will experience a backward push. <<|needle|>>This is because the body of the passenger was continuing in its state of rest when the bus was starting its motion. <<|needle|>>Similarly, when the bus stops abruptly the passenger will experience a forward push because as the bus stops, the passenger’s body was still in state of motion. <<|needle|>>The above situation is described as inertia.\nVerification of Newton's First Law of Motion\nVerify Newton's first law of Motion\nNewton's first law can be verified by performing the below simple experiment.\nActivity 1\nExperiment\nAim: To verify Newton’s 1st law of motion.\nMaterials and apparatus: Glass, manila card and small coin.\nProcedures.\nA small coin is placed on a manila card and the card is positioned on top of the glass such that the coin is directly positioned over the open mouth of the bottle.Flick the card at C. <<|needle|>>Make sure that the card is not tilted by moving the finger in the horizontal plane.\nObservation: When the card is flicked away quickly by finger, the coin drops neatly into the glass. <<|needle|>>The coin dropped into the glass because there was no force applied on it when the card was flipped.\nConclusion: The coin continued to be at rest as the card was flicked quickly. <<|needle|>>This experiment verify Newton’s 1st law of motion.\n2nd Law of Motion\nThe Concept of Linear Momentum\nExplain concept of linear momentum\nLinear momentum is one of important aspect used to explain the motion of a body in a straight line. <<|needle|>>Linear momentum is obtained as the product of mass and velocity A body with a larger mass and the one with smaller mass will possess different amount of momentum when moving with same velocity. <<|needle|>>A body with smaller mass can be stopped easily compared to the one with the larger mass. <<|needle|>>That is to say, larger mass bodies possess large momentum than smaller mass bodies. <<|needle|>>Linear momentum has both magnitude and direction. <<|needle|>>The SI unit of linear momentum is simply the combination of the individual SI units of mass and velocity. <<|needle|>>Therefore, the SI unit of linear momentum is Kilogram -Metre per second (kgm/s). <<|needle|>>The linear momentum is determined by measuring the mass of the body and its velocity. <<|needle|>>A body with large mass and moving with high velocity possess large momentum. <<|needle|>>Since them mass of the body remains constant in most of the times, the momentum will only change if its velocity changes. <<|needle|>>What is a linear momentum of a 10ton lorry moving with 60m/s? A ball weighing 3kg has been kicked and found to move at 35m/s. <<|needle|>>Calculate the linear momentum of the ball. <<|needle|>>This law explains the effect of the external force on the momentum of the body. <<|needle|>>The applied force can increase or decrease the momentum of the body. <<|needle|>>The rate of the momentum change depends on the amount of the applied force.\nVerification of Newton's Second Law of Motion\nVerify Newton's second law of Motion\nNewton's second law can be verified by observing the changes between the applied force and acceleration. <<|needle|>>This can be verified by through the trolley experiment.\nA trolley experiences an acceleration when an external force is applied to it. <<|needle|>>The aim of this data logging experiment is to explore the relationship between the magnitudes of the external force and the resulting acceleration.\nApparatus and materials\nTake care when masses fall to the floor. <<|needle|>>Use a box or tray lined with bubble wrap (or similar) under heavy objects being lifted. <<|needle|>>This will prevent toes or fingers from being in the danger zone.<image>Impulse\nImpulse is the change of momentum which is given as the product of force and the time taken to change momentum.Therefore, impulse is the change in momentum of a body which is acted by a force. <<|needle|>>The forces which act over short time intervals are called impulsive forces.\n\nAfter collision, the two bodies moved with velocities Va and Vb in opposite direction to each other as shown below;\n\nDuring collision, there are large changes of forces within a very short time (impulses).\n\nSince there are no external forces acting on the system;The Crown's Helena Bonham Carter: Series Has 'Moral Responsibility' to Label Itself as DramatizationNetflix’s The Crown has once again made headlines for taking creative license with real-life royalty — and Helena Bonham Carter thinks the show ought to clear up this fresh wave of confusion. <<|needle|>>END_OF_DOCUMENT_TOKEN_TO_BE_REPLACED\n\nThe Performers of the Week (TIE): Rosario Dawson and Billie PiperTHE SHOW | The Mandalorian\n\nEmmys 2020 Poll: Who Should Win for Supporting Actress in a Drama Series?When Meryl Streep is nominated for an award, and she’s not the frontrunner?

At The Disco live: Brendon Urie emerges as the greatest showmanIt’s over a decade since Panic! At the Disco played their first show in London. <<|needle|>>Back in early 2006 the then-glittering baroque pop quartet upstaged headliners The Academy Is… in a swift and sweaty support slot at The Astoria. <<|needle|>>Blasting through tunes from their divisive debut ‘A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out’, it was evident even then that this was a band meant to be the top billing on a line-up, and indeed it was only a few months until they returned to the UK on their own headline tour.\n\nTonight’s venue, the cavernous O2 Arena, makes it one of the biggest the band have ever played in the UK, and it’s packed out. <<|needle|>>There are hundreds of teenagers in snaking queues around the venue waiting to get a glimpse of the latest Panic! merch; but it’s not just younger fans here tonight, with swathes of revellers who clearly grew up on the band’s music embarking on a nostalgia trip.As an intimidating countdown clock reaches zero, the 20,000-capacity arena erupts with high-pitched shrieks as a string quartet introduction begins. <<|needle|>>Launching himself through the stage, Brendon Urie looks every inch the pop star in leather trousers and a glitzy blazer. <<|needle|>>Opening with ‘(Fuck A) Silver Lining’, from latest album last year’s ‘Pray for the Wicked‘, the frontman is flanked by his band, which includes a string trio and small brass line.\n\nThis is very clearly Brendon’s show. <<|needle|>>As he manoeuvres the stage it’s an expertly choreographed courtship dance, with not a single step out of place. <<|needle|>>“I’ve been doing this for almost fifteen years,” he notes, “some of you aren’t even that old!”\n\nAnd the show tonight feels like he’s reached his final form. <<|needle|>>Brendon plays a white grand piano for a cover of Bonnie Rait’s ‘I Can’t Make You Love Me’  atop a white disc that flies across the crowd. <<|needle|>>During ‘Girls/Girls/Boys’, fans are given heart-shaped paper to cover their iPhone flashes, so that the arena is illuminated in the colours of the pride flag. <<|needle|>>There are copious amounts of pyro and endless confetti cannons. <<|needle|>>At one point he covers The Greatest Showman’s Hugh Jackman-led number ‘The Greatest Show’, and the wine mums in the audience lose their shit. <<|needle|>>It’s big and bombastic and endlessly good fun for the entire two hour, 28-song set.He finds brief moments to address the crowd, constantly thanking them and offering nuggets of wisdom to the younger members of the congregation (“to you younger people who feel like you’re being bullied or don’t belong – let me tell you you do”). <<|needle|>>And then after his trademark cover of ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’, he pops a crown on that a fan has thrown on stage, and sinks down to below the stage after a roof-raising version of ‘Emperor’s New Clothes’.\n\nEmerging topless and clutching a red cup for the encore, Brendon is reminiscent of a cult leader addressing to his adoring fans. <<|needle|>>“Thank you for being here and thank you for existing,” he preaches, “we only get to do this because of you… Of course you know that because you’re geniuses!”\n\nHe explains that he used to make pretend guitars out of cardboard and sing Blink 182 songs, and then delights with the words many OG stans of the band will have been waiting for: “Now we’re going to do a song that got it all started for Panic!”. <<|needle|>>The opening pizzicato strings of ‘I Write Sins Not Tragedies’ soar across the O2. <<|needle|>>As thousands of fans scream back the words, Brendon for once seems to lose his cool, seeming genuinely humbled.\n\nFinishing with yet another speech (“It’s kind of insane that any of us were born… The only reason you’re here on planet earth is because you had to beat millions of other tadpoles… You started life as a winner in first place!”), Brendon rolls into the finale of 2015’s ‘Victorious’. <<|needle|>>Flamboyant, extravagant and a bit musical theatre, Panic! at the Disco have emerged from the noughties emo junkyard as pop-rock pioneers, and long may this continue.\n\nPanic! at the Disco played:\n\n‘(Fuck A) Silver Lining’\n‘Don’t Threaten Me With a Good Time’\n‘Ready to Go (Get Me Out

one archetype of the City office block, from 1950s solid sandstone to 1980s high-tech glass and steel. <<|needle|>>Now John Robertson Architects’ revamp builds a new harmony between those two conflicting identitiesBracken House in the City of London is a handsome relic of a bygone age of office architecture. <<|needle|>>First completed in 1958, the brick and sandstone block is from a time when the default office model in London’s financial and oldest district was not a faceless glass tower but a solidly muscular mid-rise masonry building whose proportions, detailing and materials expertly evoked the spirit of local urban heritage.\n\nBut it is also a building that has gone through several upheavals, including its reinterpretation as an exemplar of high-tech by Hopkins Architects in the late 1980s. <<|needle|>>Its latest upheaval is a major refurbishment by John Robertson Architects, aiming to update the building to modern office standards while retaining the uncompromising high-tech character Hopkins bestowed. <<|needle|>>Critically, it also seeks to foster a more sympathetic connection between the original 1950s block and the phased sequence of new modern interventions.\n\nBracken House was built between 1955 and 1958 on a cleared Second World War bombsite just south-east of St Paul’s cathedral. <<|needle|>>It was designed by eminent 20th-century architect and Georgian Group founder Albert Richardson, in a modern classical style infused with light industrial references. <<|needle|>>Its original purpose as the headquarters of the Financial Times determined the choice of a handsome sandstone exterior, mimicking the pink livery of the newspaper.Bracken House was originally built in 1955-58\n\nBracken House is considered one of the best post-war office buildings in the City of London. <<|needle|>>Intriguingly, its unlikely inspiration was the Palazzo Carignano in Turin, a sumptuous baroque pile that has a wing on each side, enclosing an elliptical central range – just like Bracken House today, though the office building’s original configuration had a rectilinear central range not an elliptical one. <<|needle|>>This historical reference was also influential during concept design stages of the latest project.\n\nBy the late 1980s most of the newspapers traditionally based in the City had left for new pastures in east London. <<|needle|>>The Financial Times’ departure in 1988 freed the Bracken House site for redevelopment into a speculative office block, and Michael Hopkins’ practice was appointed to the project. <<|needle|>>Controversially, Hopkins’ initial plan was to demolish the building and replace it with a new glass and steel construction. <<|needle|>>This was only prevented at the eleventh hour by an August 1987 grade II* spot-listing, which earned Bracken House a place in history as the first post-war building in England to be listed.\n\nHopkins then quite literally went back to the drawing board and produced the compromise configuration we recognise today. <<|needle|>>The two brick wings were retained while the central block that previously housed the printing presses was demolished to make way for Hopkins’ high-tech glass and steel central insertion. <<|needle|>>Hopkins’ efforts were themselves awarded a further grade II* listing in 2013. <<|needle|>>Now, more than three decades later – and partly prompted by the latest overhaul – the Financial Times is moving back into the building that was its original home.While it was wider industrial and economic changes rather than any issues with the building itself that earlier prompted the Financial Times to move out, by the beginning of this decade Bracken House was beginning to exhibit problems. <<|needle|>>In the new refurbishment, addressing these was a priority, as John Robertson director David Magyar explains.\n\n“The building housed an outdated office spec in urgent need of modernisation. <<|needle|>>Building services were inefficient and lacked current low-energy capabilities. <<|needle|>>The entrance hall felt limited and constrained. <<|needle|>>The atrium Hopkins placed at the centre of the plan also felt gloomy and offered insufficient levels of natural light. <<|needle|>>The building lacked any rooftop amenity. <<|needle|>>And significantly, the redevelopment sought a better connection between Hopkins’ work and the original Richardson areas, which can sometimes feel separate and isolated.”\n\nIn terms of architectural response, the new refurbishment scheme addresses these challenges by dividing itself into three main areas of concern. <<|needle|>>First is the overhaul of the entrance and atrium. <<|needle|>>Second is the creation of a new roof terrace. <<|needle|>>And the final and most structurally invasive intervention is the insertion of two new lightwells into the floorplate to create a better connection between the Hopkins and Richardson volumes.The lobby has been widened to increase visual impact\n\nThe new entrance foyer has undergone several subtle adjustments to increase its size, impact and connection with the atrium beyond. <<|needle|>>The reception desk has been moved to the side to allow a clear view towards the atrium. <<|needle|>>The two bronze and timber screens that frame the lobby have been dismantled and reconstructed in new locations to provide a more expansive feel. <<|needle|>>And new fixtures such as sparkling terrazzo flooring have been installed.\n\nThe atrium occupies the building’s full height. <<|needle|>>It has a bank of rebuilt glass lifts as its centrepiece and is overlooked by glass-fronted offices on every floor. <<|needle|>>The space is also surmounted by a large rooflight. <<|needle|>>Offices from the high-tech era – most famously the Lloyd’s Building – can struggle to achieve good levels of natural light in their internal atriums. <<|needle|>>So here a central section of Hopkins’ original gridded glass-block skylight has been replaced by clear glazing to increase the atrium’s daylight factor by 150%.\n\nAccording to project director Zemien Lee, the interventions in the latest refurbishment have been characterised by a finely tuned balance between new and old. <<|needle|>>“It’s a listed building and we’ve very much retained the spirit of Hopkins’ original language of timber, concrete, terrazzo and stainless steel. <<|needle|>>But we’ve also tried to reinterpret it and leave our own subtle mark while always remaining respectful.”<image>As no roof terrace existed before, there was a large degree of creative freedom in installing an ambitious new one. <<|needle|>>Intriguingly, Hopkins did plan a roof terrace as part of his original design. <<|needle|>>But roof terraces were increasingly discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, after the volatility in financial markets triggered by the Big Bang of financial deregulation and the subsequent recession led to alarming rates of suicide in the City, with financial workers jumping from the top of buildings.\n\nThirty years later, the restricting factor is not suicide risk but viewing corridors. <<|needle|>>While the new roof terrace offers spectacular panoramas of the city and cathedral, St Paul’s Heights – the invisible viewing corridors through which strategic views of the cathedral must be maintained and within which Bracken House directly falls – imposes a formidable set of design restrictions. <<|needle|>>The strict datum line imposed ensures that with the exception of the perimeter guard rail, the very highest structure permitted on the roof is low-level plinth seating only located at one end of the terrace. <<|needle|>>Considering that 60-storey office towers are shooting up just yards from Bracken House, this might be considered an illustration of the contradictions in London’s high-rise planning policy.\n\nThere were other constraints, as Magyar explains. <<|needle|>>“There were structural challenges due to the limited loading capacity of the original roof. <<|needle|>>We had to ensure the seating and planters comprised lightweight framework and were only clad with Corian [acrylic polymer] rather than built from it, in order to reduce their weight. <<|needle|>>There was also an amount of tidying up that had to be done in order to preserve views: the BMU [building maintenance unit] crane had to be dismantled, for instance, and we now use alpinists connected to harnesses to clean the windows.”\n\nNonetheless, within these constraints an impressive rooftop space has been created. <<|needle|>>And in a poetic nod to the baroque masterpiece that originally inspired Bracken House, the rooftop’s radial paving and seating pattern is an extruded representation of the structure of the Palazzo Carignano’s dome.The final major intervention is focused on the two new internal lightwells created at either end of the building. <<|needle|>>These are located on the boundary between the outlying retained Richardson blocks and the central Hopkins floorplates. <<|needle|>>They replace former toilet blocks, and Magyar is keen to point out that they do not compromise the total floor area. <<|needle|>>The building still offers the 200,000ft² of floor space it provided prior to the refurbishment.\n\nThe three- and four-storey lightwells were made by cutting into the floorplates to create what Magyar calls “breathing space between the two areas to relieve the tension that previously existed there”. <<|needle|>>Previously, the connection between the Hopkins and Richardson areas was said to be clumsily abrupt, with little attempt made to consolidate the two. <<|needle|>>Floor levels that differed from one to the other did not help: although Bracken House is only seven storeys high, there were double that amount of floor levels within the entire building.Once the hole for the lightwells had been cut, temporary steel props were installed within them to maintain the integrity and stability of the surrounding structure during construction. <<|needle|>>New steel ring beams tied into the building’s structural frame were then placed around the exposed slab edges, eventually allowing for the props’ removal.\n\nThough relatively modest in size, the lightwells allow a clear separation between the Hopkins and Richardson elements of the building, creating a more legible and honest relationship than before. <<|needle|>>They also feature the same architectural language employed in the atrium and lobby. <<|needle|>>They are overlooked by glass-fronted offices, feature oak panelling on the walls and feature exposed concrete and steelwork in their structure and staircases. <<|needle|>>As such they are effective metaphors for a wider refurbishment scheme that largely succeeds in treading the fine and difficult line between respect for heritage and creative conviction in new interventions.Wuling Almaz RS, a modern and classy SUV that offers not only a myriad of advanced features, but also a practicality when driving with family. <<|needle|>>On this occasion, Rizky Kinos and Nycta Gina along with their two children on the KinosGina channel are enjoying traveling around the city with a family car of Almaz RS!\n\nThe convenience of My Wuling+ ApplicationGina's first impression when getting ready to travel with Kinos was the convenience of starting the car via a smartphone. <<|needle|>>Even if the user is out of the house or out of town, they can start the car easily. <<|needle|>>The step is simply by opening the My Wuling+ application and clicking turn on the engine on the application. <<|needle|>>Besides that, you can also turn on the air conditioner so that the cabin is cold when you enter the car.\n\nNot only that, the Almaz RS also has advanced security features of Geofencing Security where it allows users to get a notification on their smartphone whenever something unexpected occurs.The exterior appearance of the Almaz RS, according to this family, looks cool with a strong and solid dynamic design body. <<|needle|>>At the front there is a sporty and dashing front grille equipped with projector headlights that adds an elegant impression to it.\n\nAccording to Kinos, the Almaz RS is really a family car. <<|needle|>>As in the front row seats, it offers ample space in the third row so that passengers at the back can sit more comfortably. <<|needle|>>In addition, the seats are also very comfortable and wrapped in black synthetic leather which further accentuates the exclusive impression.One of the other advantages that Kinos and Gina feel on the Almaz RS is online music and online navigation that are connected to the internet and can be arranged via smartphones. <<|needle|>>That way, they can comfortably use music applications or navigation on smartphones on the head unit embedded in the car dashboard.The next sophisticated feature of Almaz RS is the Wuling Indonesian Command (WIND), which according to Kinos, allows users to operate features in the car using only the voice feature, hence making traveling easy and comfortable with the family. <<|needle|>>This is where Kinos demonstrates how to open and close windows with just a voice command.\n\nThe next thing that caught the attention of Kinos and Gina was the 0.82 m2 Panoramic Sunroof feature. <<|needle|>>With this wide size, the Panoramic Sunroof Almaz RS is the largest in its class which reaches 70% of the total roof. <<|needle|>>Thus, passengers up to the third row can get a better view of the outside, as well as passengers in the front and middle seats.<image>To support safety while driving, Kinos explained that this Almaz is equipped with the Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) feature. <<|needle|>>There are several ADAS features that caught the attention of Kinos.\n\nThe first is Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) which allows users to set a safe distance from the vehicle in front according to the speed set. <<|needle|>>This feature can be adjusted via the head unit or directly on the steering wheel of up to 150 km/hour.\n\nThe second is Bend Cruise Assistance (BCA) which allows the car to reduce speed automatically when it meets a corner. <<|needle|>>The existence of these two features can help the driver, because the sensors are located throughout the car body.\n\nOther features that impressed Kinos and Gina are Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA), both are very useful when the driver gets out of the lane. <<|needle|>>First, the LDW will give a warning so that the driver can return to the correct lane. <<|needle|>>However, if the warning is still ignored because the driver is sleepy, then LKA will return the car to the correct lane so that the car remains in a safe condition.\n\nThe Almaz RS is also equipped with Forward Collision Warning (FCW), which will provide a warning of a collision ahead of time so that the driver can be more secure while driving. <<|needle|>>The sensitivity can also be adjusted from low, medium and high. <<|needle|>>This feature is also assisted by the Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) which will brake the car automatically when the driver ignores the warning given by the FCW.\n\nThere is also an Intelligent Head Beam Assistance (IHMA) feature that adjusts the high and low light intensity according to the conditions around the car.\n\nAnother safety feature is Intelligent Hydraulic Braking Assistance (IHBA) which allows the car to adjust the braking force according to its speed. <<|needle|>>So when you press the brake but not strong enough, the car will automatically help braking so as to avoid accidents.\n\nThings to be Considered when Buying

editor, which still doesn't have Markdown support, and only supports BBCode.\n\nBesides Markdown, one of the things we found we wanted right away was real-time previews. <<|needle|>>There's no reason these days to make a round-trip to the server just to preview some formatted text. <<|needle|>>We were able to just compile our server-side Markdown-parsing code to WebAssembly and run it on the client. <<|needle|>>This worked really well! There was only one snag:\n\nThis crash didn't make a lot of sense. <<|needle|>>It says the tab is out of memory, but this occurs even if you never interact with the page. <<|needle|>>In fact, if you profile the page, it's clear that no user code is running. <<|needle|>>The heap size isn't even growing. <<|needle|>>So how could we be running out of memory?Commenting out most of the Go code made the issue go away, so it was clear that something in our WASM was the culprit. <<|needle|>>But with no code running, how could that be? Furthermore, the page was interactive and real-time previews were working, so the WASM code was definitely running. <<|needle|>>What could be the culprit?\n\nOn a recent episode of the Handmade Network podcast, Asaf reminded me that Chrome actually has another profiler, which can profile Chrome itself. <<|needle|>>Since it didn't look like our code was directly causing any problems, it felt like that was worth a shot. <<|needle|>>It took some fiddling to figure out which categories were relevant, but eventually we turned up something interesting:This was clearly the problem. <<|needle|>>It was related to WASM, and it was the only thing running in the browser at the time of the crash. <<|needle|>>From function names like wasm.CompileTopTier and V8.WasmOptimization, it was clear that optimization was to blame somehow. <<|needle|>>But we were confused - the code was clearly already compiled. <<|needle|>>The WASM code was running successfully, after all.\n\nAfter a little digging, Asaf found the section of code that was actually crashing. <<|needle|>>The internals of V8 are a bit much for us to follow, but from context we were able to glean that it was part of a system called \"TurboFan\". <<|needle|>>We looked it up and it turns out TurboFan is a compiler within V8 that is designed to heavily optimize code (both WebAssembly and JavaScript) after the initial JIT has finished.\n\nThis is an interesting principle in V8 and one I didn't realize applied to WASM as well as JavaScript. <<|needle|>>This page breaks down the process further, but the quick version is that V8 actually has multiple JIT compilers optimized for different things. <<|needle|>>The first compiler, known as Liftoff, is designed to get code up and running quickly, with few optimizations. <<|needle|>>After Liftoff has finished and the page is interactive, TurboFan kicks in and recompiles everything at a high level of optimization, replacing the Liftoff results as it goes. <<|needle|>>The result is that the user can see results very quickly, but also have excellent performance overall. <<|needle|>>It's a smart design.\n\nBut clearly something was wrong. <<|needle|>>Many of the slow functions had \"TF\" in the name, clearly referring to TurboFan. <<|needle|>>We also tested the page with TurboFan turned off and the problem disappeared. <<|needle|>>So we knew that optimization was to blame. <<|needle|>>But now we had more questions: which function was actually causing TurboFan to explode? And why?\n\nTrying to analyze the WASM file directly wasn't fruitful; at 15MB, it took way too long to convert to the textual format through wasm2wat, and even when I did get parts of it converted, I didn't learn much. <<|needle|>>(I learned later that I could use wasm-objdump to help, but at the time I didn't know this.) I ended up resorting to trial and error within the Go code, importing specific packages and commenting things out until I found the cause.\n\nThis was the cause, and this was just a small section of the resulting WebAssembly (in textual form):This code was from our Markdown library, Goldmark. <<|needle|>>It's no wonder TurboFan has a hard time optimizing this; this is just a small fraction of the blocks present in this function. <<|needle|>>I knew from some prior work that blocks were part of how WASM handles branches and jumps, but why was this code so branchy at all? Why would there be any branches when you're just initializing a map?\n\nAnswering this question will require us to dig into the Go compiler a little bit, and look at the assembly it generates.\n\nHere's a small example of the assembly Go generates for a map. <<|needle|>>I've heavily edited the assembly for clarity, including deleting a bunch of code that didn't seem relevant, so know that this only shows the general structure.\n\nIf you follow all the jumps, you'll see that control flow is not exactly straightforward! If the GC is active at some point during this initialization, then the code could potentially jump all over the place.\n\nImportantly for us, notice that Go generates multiple chunks of assembly for each entry of the map. <<|needle|>>Each entry gets the normal straightforward path, and the GC-active path, with two extra jumps as a result.\n\nNow recall that we have over 2000 map items.\n\nThe situation for us is even worse. <<|needle|>>Go seems to do this branching pattern for each memory allocation the GC needs to know about. <<|needle|>>This map of HTML entities has several of those - in addition to the map entries themselves, the structs have slices in them that are also allocated in this branchy way. <<|needle|>>So each map entry actually has six sections of assembly, and six branches.\n\nNormally I expect all this branching isn't a problem. <<|needle|>>CPUs won't have any trouble following these JMP instructions, and based on some conversations on the Handmade Network Discord, I suspect that the assembly is structured this way to result in good branch prediction for the typical case where the GC is inactive. <<|needle|>>But WebAssembly is different. <<|needle|>>All branches must be expressed in a structured way using the block, if, and loop instructions (spec). <<|needle|>>There are several good reasons for this. <<|needle|>>However, I don't think the authors of V8 expected to ever see so many nested blocks.\n\nAt this point Asaf suggested that we could fork Goldmark and initialize this map in a more efficient way. <<|needle|>>If we could find a way to avoid having so many branches, V8 would probably be happy.\n\nTurns out he was right! We turned the map literal into an array literal, and then looped over it on startup to create the map, like so:\n\nThis approach resulted in much smaller generated code: just the few branches required for the loop, with one GC management section. <<|needle|>>All of the data was now in the data section of the WASM file instead of hardcoded into the assembly. <<|needle|>>Not only did this immediately solve our problem, but it actually made our WASM file smaller by two full megabytes!This experience for me perfectly captures what is so powerful about the Handmade ethos. <<|needle|>>Asaf and I ran into a bizarre problem with no apparent cause. <<|needle|>>But through our combined knowledge, our willingness to dig deep into the underlying layers, and our experience doing so, we were able to solve our problem in just a few hours. <<|needle|>>And this in the constantly-vilified world of web development, no less!\n\nOf course, it would be nice for this situation to not come up again in other places. <<|needle|>>While I'm not exactly sure what the best fix would be, I have a couple ideas:\n\nOf course, both of these ideas could be wrong. <<|needle|>>But I hope that the issue can somehow be mitigated so that it doesn't bite other people in the future!Many classic car collectors begin their racing adventures with a Jaguar XK. <<|needle|>>The reasons are multiple: it is user-friendly, parts are easy to come by, and there are specialists who have the necessary experience to prepare it. <<|needle|>>One of these is CKL Developments in East Sussex, UK, one of the world’s leading experts in Jaguar XK and E-type racing preparation. <<|needle|>>And I learned that inside one of their cavernous buildings they had a very special racing XK120 with a lot of history…<image>This LHD roadster, or OTS, as the British preferred to call it in period (the abbreviation stands for Open Two Seater), started its life in July, 1952, when it was manufactured and promptly shipped to the US of A. <<|needle|>>Actually more cars were made in LHD than in RHD form, as in the early 1950’s Jaguar, in order to survive and to secure rationed supplies of vital steel, had to export cars at all costs. <<|needle|>>Most of them went to the US, where the first production XK120 was delivered to Clark Gable, the world-famous movie actor. <<|needle|>>This one had been ordered by the Hornburg Jaguar dealership of Los Angeles: in fact the West Hollywood company started to sell Jaguars in 1947, and it still does! The sleek Jag was bought by one Mr. <<|needle|>>Stephen A. <<|needle|>>Bodensieck, a gunsmith who was also a car enthusiast, and loved to tinker with Jaguars and Ferraris. <<|needle|>>He enjoyed his British sports car, but his restless spirit probably made him move on to something else, and he sold the XK.The second US owner was Mr. <<|needle|>>Dick Miladelaroca, who used the car the way its makers had intended: racing it on Sundays. <<|needle|>>He took part in a number of Vintage Auto Racing Association events. <<|needle|>>We don’t know how fast he was, but he must have kept the car in perfect shape, because records show that the XK120 had won a Jaguar Club concours d’elegance event while in the custody of Mr. <<|needle|>>Miladelaroca. <<|needle|>>Original photos of the car racing in the States exist, and it seems the British vehicle enjoyed itself away from its ancestral home. <<|needle|>>At some point CSK 303 (the car’s numberplate) was repatriated to the United Kingdom, and became a familiar sight at race events. <<|needle|>>Prepared by CKL Developments, it took part in HSCC meetings, and the JEC Jaguar XK Championship in the hands of a number of proficient drivers.And now I am driving it. <<|needle|>>Much more slowly, of course. <<|needle|>>We are not at a racetrack, but on a public road in East Sussex. <<|needle|>>A twisty road, bordered with ditches, shrubbery, and unyielding trees. <<|needle|>>I am driving over 100,000 British pounds of historic racing car, and I am tempted to really put my foot down. <<|needle|>>The Jag has a freshly-built Sigma 3.8 engine, which started easily, but idled in an enchantingly lumpy way when warmed up, hinting at the competition-bred power within. <<|needle|>>As I wiggled my fat frame into the seat, I noticed some new instruments in the cockpit which otherwise had been left in a nicely patinated condition. <<|needle|>>This XK has been raced all its life, and it is ready to race now (eligible for the 2020 Jaguar Classic Challenge one-hour race, preceding the Le Mans Classic 24-hour event), albeit it carries a legal numberplate. <<|needle|>>The suspension is set up pretty low, and during my test drive I wince several times as the bottom of the rear muffler scrapes against the uneven tarmac, creating a modest shower of sparks.That said, the chassis composure is truly reassuring and the steering feels taut and precise, making me long for a track session at the Silverstone Grand Prix circuit. <<|needle|>>In the meantime, however, I revel in the low-end grunt of the engine which seems to keep pulling whatever the rev level. <<|needle|>>The gearshift requires some getting used to, but the modified brakes feel fantastic, strong and positive. <<|needle|>>They are not the original drums of the year 1952, and the car does not comply with the strict FIA rules, but can nevertheless be raced in a number of race series. <<|needle|>>At the same time it is an ideal proposition for beginner race drivers, especially those with no previous experience of early cars, those requiring more skill. <<|needle|>>Once they have mastered this XK120, it will have given them a lot of confidence, as it is expertly set up to be fast, but not treacherous. <<|needle|>>I feel completely at ease in it, and, once I am used to the gearshift action, I can go faster and enjoy an almost total lack of the expected understeer. <<|needle|>>This is one composed sports car, certainly much better than when it was new.<image>Just a few minutes of driving this great XK immerses me in some sort of a daydream, in which I push the Jaguar to the limit, accelerating out of Tertre Rouge onto the long Hunaudières straight at Le Mans. <<|needle|>>And daydreams usually end abruptly… so does this one, when I have to slow down and direct the Jaguar’s long nose into the gate, and later into the workshop. <<|needle|>>As it cools down, making all kinds of minute noises, I reflect on what a perfect tool it is for a classic car enthusiast who started off in something like an MGB, and is ready to graduate to something more serious and much faster. <<|needle|>>Out of my reach, unfortunately. <<|needle|>>Nothing like a reality check to end an otherwise perfect day…Our thanks to Rupert Manwaring and the helpful staff at CKL Developments (ckl.co.uk) for their invaluable help in producing this feature.The rape and brutal murder of eight-year-old Asifa Bano in Kathua, India, has triggered nationwide outrage and inflamed communal tensions.\n\nThe young girl was murdered in January in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAccording to the police charge sheet, Asifa was forced to take sedatives and was abducted by a school dropout, a minor and an accomplice on January 10, and was held captive in a shed and then a Hindu temple for five days.Asifa was repeatedly raped by different men, including a police constable, before being strangled and beaten with a stone.\n\nHer body was discovered on January 17 and according to police, she would have been killed sooner had one man not insisted on waiting so he could rape her a final time.\n\nAsifa belonged to a Muslim nomadic tribe and the men the police have arrested, which include a retired government official, four police officers and a minor, all  belong to a local Hindu community that has been involved in a land dispute with the Muslim nomads.<image>Asifa was repeatedly raped by different men, including a police constable, before being strangled and beaten with a stone and people in India are demanding justice for the young girl's

his band, West Of Eden, opened for the likes of The Butthole Surfers and Bang Tango in the 90’s with alternative band, Rosary Violet and played festivals all across the U.S. <<|needle|>>as the bald, bearded, bare-footed, bass playing lead singer with an affinity for kilt wearing in Celtic rock band, Finn’s Fury, whose music was featured in numerous theatrical releases that are better left unnamed.\n\nHe was once called “the funkiest white boy I’ve ever heard play bass”, by Nile Rogers of CHIC fame.\n\nA firm believer of fun with facial hair and the higher the platform shoe the better, Doom brings the fun in funky regalia to BBL and is in constant competition with Steve Stewart as to who can reach the highest harmonies. <<|needle|>>He’s no stranger to singing lead and takes the helm for Bowie’s “Fame” & “Heroes”, ELO’s “Do Ya?” , as well as many others.\n\nHe’s also greatly opposed to the juggling of kittens, finding it mildly amusing but extremely cruel.\n\nWhen he’s not stomping the stage with his Fender Precision, Doom is endorsed by and plays Danelectro basses provided by the best damn music store on Long Island, All Music Inc.Steve Stewart has played all over… Las Vegas, Atlantic City, anywhere and everywhere in New York that’s worth playing. <<|needle|>>He’s toured with SALTY DOG, performs with THE BIG SHOW and CHRONICLES and has the added distinction of being thrown out of multiple projects like U2 and Stevie Ray Vaughn tributes due to his penchant for “overplaying”. <<|needle|>>Stating that, “Most people don’t like me”, he’s unforgiving in his “I am what I am” persona. <<|needle|>>But perch him behind a drum set and allow him to show too much chest and you’ll very quickly see why he’s a solid addition to BILLBOARD LIVE.\n\nYeah, he hits the snare way too hard, but what the hell do you want in a rock band?\n\nAside from his ability to sing all the high harmonies, Steve has a front man’s vocal abilities and\n\nshows just that on his featured songs, “AMERICAN BAND”, “LOVE IS ALIVE” and “GET READY”.\n\nSteve’s known for not saying goodbye when leaving a room because goodbye’s are too painful and make hime sad. <<|needle|>>He also has a weakness for a fine pair of moccasins.Brian Connolly has been lurking around the Long Island music scene for the last 36 years, cutting his teeth in the Hamptons with The Hackensack Men and the Trenton Horns, a 12 piece Soul/ R&B line-up he formed with some mates in the early 1980’s. <<|needle|>>Brian has also participated in the tribute band craze, playing the music of James Taylor, Stevie Nicks, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Bruce Springsteen, etc….\n\nNow with 70s Rock Parade, Brian relishes the opportunity to recreate the Hammond B3, Fender Rhodes, Wurly, and piano sounds he’s grown up loving, and that are synonymous with the 70’s classic Rock era, all while sharing the stage with four other so-called fantastic musicians, and gentlemen of questionable repute.\n\nDrop us a message!While England is

best festivals the rest of Europe has to offer and get your plane tickets sorted…This Croatian festival has everything going in its favour; prime location, huge line up, idyllic scenery and weather… All in all, it’s simply a must for any fan of bass music. <<|needle|>>It’s not often you get the chance to rave in the ramparts of an abandoned fort, which includes a vast moat, or that you get the chance to see your favourite DJs on a boat in the middle of the ocean. <<|needle|>>This year’s line up features Noisia, Jurassic 5 and Goldie, to name just a few…Set in the same incredible location as Outlook, Dimensions is something of a more chilled out affair with less drum & bass and more techno. <<|needle|>>Similarly to its older, angrier cousin, Dimensions features a mightily impressive line up which consistently showcases the finest purveyors of electronic music. <<|needle|>>This year’s event features Four Tet live, Ben Klock and Little Dragon.Our very own beach festival… This one can’t

Certainly not manage as usual.\n\nStructured, integrated inflation management is required. <<|needle|>>What must be done is not complicated, but it is easy to omit levers. <<|needle|>>Here we prescribe an integrated framework for action.\n\nBuilding on previous posts in this series on inflation management, we discuss:\n\nInflation management is a multifaceted task for a CEO. <<|needle|>>We created TIRF based on academic literature to give an integrated view on what levers to pull.<image>The framework is the starting point for discussions within the C-suite, business units, and geographic units. <<|needle|>>It also points to what various executives need to report back on to headquarters.\n\nOnce the company has quantified and operationalized TIRF, the results should feed into an update of strategic and financial plans.\n\nHow long does implementing TIRF take?\n\nIn a large company around one month if the automated tools are available and appropriate processes are in place. <<|needle|>>Longer if the current planning processes are based on “Excel-Powerpoint-Email.”\n\nNext, we discuss each of the TIRF levers.\n\nRevenue and cost were discussed in Part 4 of this series. <<|needle|>>We add a few observations here. <<|needle|>>The three other levers are new.\n\nFirst, the company should track inflation-adjusted sales for internal purposes (how to communicate with the stock market is another matter). <<|needle|>>It is easy to be think one has increased sales when the real reason is inflation.\n\nFor multinational companies that track country sales at market exchange rates, the consolidated revenue should be deflated by the inflation rate in the home country. <<|needle|>>The exchange rate already captures the differential inflation between countries and home).\n\nFor those using fixed exchange rates for the year, an adjustment for the differential exchange rate between country and home is necessary.\n\nThe inflation metric should be the CPI. <<|needle|>>It is more up to date than the GDP deflator, which otherwise would be the better metric.\n\nWhat does it mean for the CEO? Make sure inflation-adjusted revenues are the metric for setting targets and are tracked monthly.\n\nSecond, in part 4 we discussed how to make the trade-off between price and advertising. <<|needle|>>This does not imply that price cuts are the only way to optimize pricing.\n\nThe framework below points to possibilities; what we call WisePrice. <<|needle|>>However, it is unlikely that consumers are fooled by clever pricing. <<|needle|>>An underlying benefit must be associated with these levers.We will expand on the WisePrice framework in a later article. <<|needle|>>For now, we point out that straight price cuts and promotional spending are not the only possibilities.\n\nImportantly, premiumization is sometimes possible in inflationary times if the right consumer groups are targeted.\n\nThe leadership of the company needs to ensure these WisePrice levers are evaluated and acted on in business units and in countries.\n\nHere are some additional recommendations beyond what was covered in Part 4 of this series.\n\nIn inflationary times it is important to track variable and fixed costs diligently.\n\nFirst, many companies do not make the split in an informed manner. <<|needle|>>They tag cost items by the fixed or variable bucket based on experience. <<|needle|>>This may however underestimate variable cost.\n\nInstead, regression analyses should be performed to find the true split. <<|needle|>>Below is such an analysis for ten companies.The level of variable cost may be surprising.¹ But note that short term (current year) variable cost usually is lower. <<|needle|>>(We save this analysis for our customers.) Nevertheless, variable cost is usually higher than executives believe.\n\nSecond, this split into true variable or fixed cost has profound impact on the understanding of future profitability. <<|needle|>>It makes it possible to make the current year budget (of utmost importance when inflation is high) much more accurate.\n\nWhat does it mean for the CEO? Make sure sensitivity analyses of budgets are based on true fixed / variable numbers. <<|needle|>>Never use EBITDA as a proxy.\n\nOne may think that assets bought at a lower price before inflation sets in is an advantage. <<|needle|>>The book value takes up less and less space on the balance sheet.\n\nBut the stock market is not concerned with book value. <<|needle|>>It looks at replacement value for the machines, buildings, trucks, and other physical assets. <<|needle|>>Tobin’s Q sets this out:\n\nQ is widely used by economists, less so by businesses. <<|needle|>>It shows that the relative value of a company declines if replacement value increases, but profitability and growth (the parts that combine to create market value) do not keep up.\n\nWhen inflation is high, replacement values go up quickly. <<|needle|>>This increases the asset burden profits need to support. <<|needle|>>In the U.S., and other countries, company market values tend not to keep up with the asset replacement cost and Q falls.\n\nWhat does it mean for the CEO? Make sure replacement values are reported quarterly so that the budget expectations on profitability and growth can be adjusted.\n\nToo many companies think only of exchange rates in nominal terms. <<|needle|>>A CFO we know said “Why am I always negatively surprised by the exchange rate when I look at our East African companies?”\n\nThe reason was that inflation was higher in those countries than in the home country. <<|needle|>>That those currencies declined was a healthy sign that the currency markets worked.\n\nThe market exchange rate view is important. <<|needle|>>It is how companies report financial statements publicly.\n\nBut for internal purposes the real (inflation-adjusted) exchange rates should be used. <<|needle|>>These are called RERs.\n\nThe graph below from FoX, our real exchange (and inflation) product, shows an example:What does it mean for the CEO? Make sure the finance unit tracks RER and that they are applied when comparing countries. <<|needle|>>This is especially important for forward-looking plans like strategies and budgets. <<|needle|>>It also means that the company needs to have a perspective on future inflation.\n\nFinally, cost of capital related to inflation. <<|needle|>>This affects both WACC and project hurdle rates.\n\nFor simplicity, assume a company that has no debt; it is thus financed by equity. <<|needle|>>Then the cost of capital equals cost of equity Kₑ:\n\nWithout going into financial theory, the risk-free rate is essentially the same as future inflation. <<|needle|>>Thus, capital cost increases with inflation.\n\nThis means that companies should update cost-of-capital tables. <<|needle|>>It also means (re-)learning how to perform discounted cash flow calculations under inflationary conditions. <<|needle|>>This is quite different from what most companies are used to.\n\nWhat does it mean for the CEO? Make sure to review the current investment / project portfolio. <<|needle|>>Previously profitable acquisitions or projects may have become unprofitable.²\n\nCEOs need to energize executives to meet the inflation management challenge in a robust and scientific manner. <<|needle|>>Our TIRF approach is an organizing framework.\n\nThe CEOs agenda does not need to be clogged. <<|needle|>>It is for the CEO to initiate proposals for action. <<|needle|>>Then the executive leadership (C-suite) ratifies those and/or other actions. <<|needle|>>Units implement the chosen actions. <<|needle|>>Finally, the CEO monitors the outcomes.³ Initiating and monitoring are not time consuming.\n\nMany of the suggested CEO actions will have to be handled manually and will take time. <<|needle|>>This is a shame because most of this is possible to automate. <<|needle|>>However, large companies are far behind the curve on such automation.\n\nTellusant is building its strategy management software to be able to handle such automation tasks. <<|needle|>>Instead of spending months and activating hundreds of people, much of the task is handled quickly and cost-efficiently.\n\nTo learn more, contact us by filling out this online form.\n\n¹ We also performed the analysis using the primitive hi-lo method. <<|needle|>>Its correlation with the regression method is 0.76.\n\n² In fact, the main conduit for reducing inflation in a country is by reducing investments.\n\n³ Initiative — Ratify — Implement — Monitor is the famous decision process defined in 1983 by Eugene Fama (Nobel Prize winner) and Michael Jensen (the most cited economics academic ever). <<|needle|>>IRIM has other names too, but they are all copycats of the original. <<|needle|>>bit.ly/3JvWYinBring your Cape (or Fedora)Two years in a row I’ve had film shoots on Halloween. <<|needle|>>Last year it was for a student film and this year I was a PA on set for a feature film – Full of Grace.The experience was incredible! Despite having to get up at four in the morning to arrive on time there was a lot of energy on set throughout the day. <<|needle|>>I think Halloween day played a factor in that because people were excited for their costumes as well as their plans for the night. <<|needle|>>I had a shirt that had “life” written on it and I had lemons that I could hand to people. <<|needle|>>(When life gives you lemons).\n\nDespite being from the East Coast (and all too familiar with the cold) going out before the sun comes up often, and walking from my apartment to my car I knew I did not dress appropriately for the early morning weather, which was cold. <<|needle|>>Fortunately, one of the assistant directors was kind enough to lend me her jacket for the day. <<|needle|>>As small as that sounds it made a huge impact on the day.\n\nA part of production that was never fully clear to me before that day was grip work. <<|needle|>>Seeing it in action I was able to understand more of what it entails and it is interesting to me. <<|needle|>>I was even able to help out with the breakdown of the set (the one just below this text).Being able to see an efficient team on set that day was very educational. <<|needle|>>On student films I’ve noticed that many crewmembers try to make decisions for each department of production (including outside their jurisdiction) and it usually takes a while to get things done. <<|needle|>>On the set of Full of Grace however, I noticed everyone was able to be self-sufficient and operate with little guidance.\nWhat I was impressed by the most was how smoothly everything moved on set, there really weren’t any hiccups or set backs that I noticed. <<|needle|>>It showed great leadership on everyone’s part and led to a great experience on set for me. <<|needle|>>That’s all I have for this time.\n\nThe Other Side: Cast & Crew Screening\nThe Nobel Troll of Craft Services<image>In 1989, PIETROS VAL R. <<|needle|>>PATRICIO was born in Athens, Greece

atlanta\nRated 4/5 based on 69 review\nncmlittleton.com - History of Radio in Dallas - Fort Worth, Texas - AMAnderson’s hands are at her neck, twisting around a fragile gold heart. <<|needle|>>It was Annabelle’s. <<|needle|>>At first, Kristen and fellow junior Sarah Movahedi are tentative, but they soon light up with memories of their childhood friend, 16-year-old Annabelle Vandenbroucke, who died July 18, six days after a tragic car accident.\n\n“When we were little, she’d show up in her brother’s clothes, and the next day she’d wear a silk dress, heels and a fur coat,” Sarah says. <<|needle|>>“She was always herself and definitely always bold.”\n\nHer parents, Jerome and Anna, now say they are just trying to deal with their lives being turned upside down. <<|needle|>>Anna carefully pets her pink velvet sweatshirt, confessing that it was her daughter’s.\n\n“I want people to remember her spirit,” she says.\n\nThat memory is alive and well within Laura Mastrocola, another one of Annabelle’s close friends. <<|needle|>>She says she has a hard time talking about Annabelle since she’s never felt a loss so overwhelming.“Annabelle was one of the most strong people that I’ve known.” Laura laughs. <<|needle|>>“She would never take anybody’s B.S. <<|needle|>>She would always stand up for herself and anyone around her.”\n\nIn middle school, Annabelle stood out in her own self-assured way when everyone else was just trying to fit in. <<|needle|>>Kristen and Sarah reminisce about the times when Annabelle would debate and play devil’s advocate. <<|needle|>>Maybe she never cared either way, but she loved the back and forth of it all.\n\n“Going into high school, we started drifting apart but we were always really close,” Sarah reflects. <<|needle|>>“Every once in a while we would all get together and have a sleepover.” Sarah pauses for a breath before pulling out her phone and sharing a picture—Kristen, Annabelle and Sarah cuddled up, peering at a computer screen—taken a few months prior to the accident.\n\nDuring her time at Carmel Middle School, Annabelle met another girl she’d soon call her best friend: Itzel Rios-Ellis, a junior at Carmel High. <<|needle|>>Laughing, Itzel admits one of her favorite memories of Annabelle took place at a girls’ sleepover. <<|needle|>>Annabelle was trying to sleep as the rest of the girls were shrieking and giggling, but it didn’t go without an honest warning to keep it down. <<|needle|>>Strong words were exchanged and a hair brush“Annabelle was not like a lot of people,” Itzel says. <<|needle|>>“She was this straight-to-the-point type of person, but she’d invite people to hang out with her if they didn’t have anyone else. <<|needle|>>She was very down-to-earth.”\n\nWhile there are echoes of that description of her personality, Annabelle also had a worldly side. <<|needle|>>Jerome reflects on memories of family travels around the world as she grew up.\n\n“That was our Anthony Bourdain moment,” Jerome recalls. <<|needle|>>“Being in the middle of the offbeat world, eating just the best food. <<|needle|>>We have many memories like that, exploring the world. <<|needle|>>She was always ready to blow off the normal and go do the crazy stuff.”\n\nJerome called some of Annabelle’s closest friends after the accident to have them say their last goodbyes to her in the hospital. <<|needle|>>Itzel went in to see Annabelle by herself, so she could talk freely to her friend.\n\n“When I saw her I realized she could probably hear me, which is what I was told,” Itzel recalls. <<|needle|>>“I was holding her hand and telling her goodbye, and maybe my mind was playing tricks on me, but I could feel her hand get tighter and tighter. <<|needle|>>I took it as a way of her letting me know she was still there.”\n\nAfter her passing, friends and family looked through clothes in Annabelle’s room to take personal belongings. <<|needle|>>Laura says that she took items that smelled of Annabelle or clothes she remembered her wearing. <<|needle|>>She also collected one of Annabelle’s drawing notebooks, with the idea of turning one into a tattoo for herself.\n\n“For her first semester book talk, she talked about ‘East of Eden,’” Schmidt says. <<|needle|>>“She seemed really into it, and to be a 14-year-old girl tackling that book was a lot.She read a lot, so when she wrote, she had good insight.”\n\nDescribed as creative both in her writing and drawing, Sarah says Annabelle was also a strong free-spirit. <<|needle|>> When she was little, Annabelle would rebelliously mismatch her shoes and socks. <<|needle|>>Now Sarah does the same in remembrance of her friend.\n\n“I took some of her shoes because I like walking in her footsteps.” Sarah sighs. <<|needle|>>“She just happened to be the same size as me.”\n\nInterview after interview, the truth becomes clear. <<|needle|>>Those closest to Annabelle Vandenbroucke reveal her soul, her childhood and her inner spirit.\n\nThe wisdom of a mother who longs for her daughter hangs in the air: “This was really a community tragedy,” Anna says. <<|needle|>>“It doesn’t just affect us.”\n\nBrockhampton bounces back with 'Iridescence' harder than ever following recent controversy<image>Light And Fast In The Cordillera Sarmiento: Jacob Slot’s First Ascent Of Cerro Tigreli In Patagonia\n\nOn October 23 and 24 of this year, we had a 36 hour weather window and managed to make an ascent of one of the unclimbed ice-covered mushroom peaks in the Cordillera Sarmiento in the West fjords of Chilean Patagonia. <<|needle|>>It was not possible to ski from the mushroom summit but we found our way from approximately 10 meters below. <<|needle|>>The summit altitude is 1626m and we named it Cerro Tigreli.Our 2016 Patagonian campaign started in early October when Arc’teryx ski alpinists Cornelia Zamernik, David Sanabria and myself, arrived one by one in the Lago Argentino zone of southern Argentinian Patagonia.\n\nWe didn’t find the best snow conditions and what we found was quite was close to our conservative predictions after a dry southern winter. <<|needle|>>Before leaving, our entire team was faced with ordinary life issues like knee surgeries, family illness, education and non-stop work. <<|needle|>>With heavy baggage like that in one’s head, Patagonia doesn’t seem to be the right place to add to the agenda: for us it was different. <<|needle|>>With more than 40 trips in common to this part of the world, going to Patagonia feels more like going home to a beautiful, peaceful place full of inspiring, rough adventures and old friends.We stayed upstairs at La Brecha in El Chalten, a newly opened Mexican restaurant owned by Max Odell. <<|needle|>>From there, we kept an eye on the weather forecast for different targets in three different areas edging the Southern Patagonian ice-cap. <<|needle|>>We got to ski some days around El Chalten with the always-motivated local community before the first sign of a weather window appeared on the Windguru weather forecast.\n\nOut of our three targets, the Cordillera Sarmiento (a four-hour boat ride from the Ultima Esperanza) always has the worst weather. <<|needle|>>We double-checked weather conditions with Dorthe Beldal, a danish friend living in Puerto Natales who can view the Sarmiento range from her house, and she confirmed our suspicions that this was our shot. <<|needle|>>We all had the same opinion that was a chance we couldn’t resist: a once in a lifetime opportunity. <<|needle|>>Cordillera Sarmiento is a name I have carried in my head since 1998 when the Chilean ambassador in Ushuaia gave me a map of the southern part of the Chilean west coast.\n\nWe basically ran away from Chalten with a short stop in Calafate before heading over the border to Puerto Natales in Chile. <<|needle|>>Hector Diaz, the owner of West Patagonia expeditions and Patagonian Fjords Boat Company, was the most important piece of our puzzle. <<|needle|>>We arrived with a plan, but after our first meeting with Hector, we had some doubts. <<|needle|>>We wanted to take advantage of the weather window on the mountain, but Hector needed one of those good days to get us there and more good weather to get us back. <<|needle|>>The four hour boat ride from the Ultimo Esperanza fjord to the Fjord of the mountains (Fiordo de las Montañas) is not possible in bad weather.Finally, we met Saturday morning at 6:00 at the pier in Puerto Natales and went to sea an hour later. <<|needle|>>It was a rough ride out of the fjord. <<|needle|>>We were hitting waves non-stop before entering Canal Morla Vicuña the connecting channel to the Fjord of the mountains. <<|needle|>>It was low tide, so navigating the channel felt like floating on a shallow river. <<|needle|>>It was a quiet moment with some time to warm up with a warm yerba mate before getting back out in the waves again. <<|needle|>>We disembarked our boat, soaked from head to toe, at a beach below the big rock around one kilometer south of the Bernal glacier.<image>After 30 minutes repacking and scouting for the right direction we moved on. <<|needle|>>Hector returned to Puerto Natales and left us with a jungle style forest for the next step of our journey. <<|needle|>>We found only tight forest on the coast. <<|needle|>>The machete was our tool of choice. <<|needle|>>We looped the bottom forest two times before we had our Alpha FL 45 packs, skis and boots at a big rock 30 vertical meters up from the beach. <<|needle|>>The trees were still tight so one was scouting and clearing the way and the others in the back bringing all the gear forward until we finally got to a steep treeless slope taking us below the hanging glacier. <<|needle|>>The ground covered in moss was soft and wet. <<|needle|>>A narrow terrace with lenga trees led us to our camp between two hanging glaciers. <<|needle|>>Before setting up the tent, we went on a short reconnaissance to understand the direction for the next day. <<|needle|>>We found a ramp to take us straight across the glacier, over and below the breaking serac areas.The reward of the first day was pole position and a great dinner sponsored by Lyo Food before squishing our 3 bodies in to a two person tent for some hours of sleeplessness. <<|needle|>>We named the camp, Campamento Esquiadores.A warm coffee fired up our bodies in the morning for an early start. <<|needle|>>We hoped to make it across the hanging glacier before temperatures would rise. <<|needle|>>After a few hours of booting and skinning up steep terrain we arrived at a small frozen lagoon below the Cinco Amigos peak. <<|needle|>>The lagoon is also the access to the southern accumulation area of Glacier Bernal, the direction we were heading. <<|needle|>>We skinned across a huge glacier plateau before the terrain got steeper and the wind picked up. <<|needle|>>Getting around and over the crevasses on the upper part of the mountain took time but we kept a high motivation and arrived at the base of the summit mushroom. <<|needle|>>We were very exposed to the strong wind gusts from the Pacific Ocean. <<|needle|>>Conny and I fixed our skis to an ice screw and left them behind. <<|needle|>>David was more positive than we had been about the approach and brought his skis to the summit. <<|needle|>>It was a beautiful climb up the mushroom-shaped, frozen rime and we were given options of two different summits. <<|needle|>>We chose the western one, which seemed to be the highest and was later confirmed to be quite a bit higher than the eastern summit. <<|needle|>>We arrived at the highest point of Cerro Tigreli after 6,5 hours of skinning and climbing. <<|needle|>>A short break before descending to our cache and David finally decided not to try to ski on the ice and followed on foot.Once below the summit, we skied perfect corn snow to the end of the glacier ramp 10 minutes from our tent, where we found a small creek running straight under it.<image>That night I slept under the stars in the Cordillera Sarmiento, the place i dreamed about for almost 20 years, with a first ascent in the pocket, done with skis, with Conny and David. <<|needle|>>It was not easy to realize how much luck we had. <<|needle|>>When we reached the beach the next morning and met Hector with the boat, it became clear that this was a great score and in a different style than the few other visitors in the past. <<|needle|>>Light and fast, in absolute alpine style with a rough boat ride.TORONTO, September 21 – It was mixed martial arts’ equivalent of a Rocky movie, Jon Jones and Alexander Gustafsson battling through five bloody and bruising rounds that captured the best the sport has to offer. <<|needle|>>When it was over, Jones retained his UFC light heavyweight title for a record sixth time via five round unanimous decision, but not without getting the fight of his life from the courageous underdog from Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n“I’ve been asking for a dogfight for a long time and I finally got the dogfight I wanted,” said Jones.“He was just a tough fighter and that was by far my toughest fight.”\n\n“It was an honor to fight Jon,” said Gustafsson. <<|needle|>>“He is the champion for a reason.”\n\nScores were 48-47 twice and 49-46 for Jones, who bested Tito Ortiz’ record for most successful 205-pound UFC title defenses, and did it the hard way, having to survive a cut over his eye and a spirited effort from a challenger who had every intention of leaving with the title “Champion” next to his name.\n\nGustafsson went right at Jones with kicks that landed and punches that didn’t. <<|needle|>>Jones’ first takedown attempt came up short, but his own kicks began hitting their mark as he chopped at the Swede’s legs. <<|needle|>>Midway through the round, Gustafsson just missed with a right hand that had home run written all over it, but the good part for him was that he was getting closer, and his confidence continued to grow, especially after cutting Jones over the right eye. <<|needle|>>With a minute left, Gustafsson even shocked Jones and the crowd by scoring a takedown. <<|needle|>>After the two rose, an eye poke by Jones brought a momentary halt to the action, and while Jones went on the offensive after the fight resumed, he was unable to do anything with the upset-minded challenger.\n\nThe fight heated up even more in the second, with Gustafsson catching a Jones kick and tripping him to the mat, and the champion subsequently going on a reckless chase of his opponent in an effort to get payback. <<|needle|>>He didn’t, but if he didn’t know before, Jones certainly knew now that he was in a fight. <<|needle|>>Jones continued to use his kicks effectively, nailing Gustafsson with a left to the face midway through the frame. <<|needle|>>Gustafsson took it well and got back to sticking and moving as Jones pursued the takedown but couldn’t get it. <<|needle|>>The champion’s kicks were keeping him in the points column though.Continuing to switch from orthodox to the southpaw stance, Jones wasn’t throwing Gustafsson off, but he was using it to set up his own kicks, which had become the cornerstone of his offense. <<|needle|>>Gustafsson focused his strikes upstairs for the most part, landing with some hard punches to the head when he got in close with Jones. <<|needle|>>Jones saved his response for the final minute with a spinning elbow that landed but didn’t do the damage he expected it to do, and after stuffing Gustafsson’s subsequent takedown attempt, he had to be feeling confident entering the championship rounds.\n\nAfter seemingly getting into a bit of a rhythm early in the fourth, both offensively and defensively, Jones began getting tagged hard by Gustafsson, opening the cut over Jones’ right eye again and forcing him to look for a takedown, which he didn’t get. <<|needle|>>But the champ kept moving forward, and after finally landing with the spinning elbow he was looking for, Jones went on the attack, landing with knees and putting “The Mauler” on the defensive for the first time in the fight, with a brawl breaking out in the final 30 seconds that got the crowd roaring.\n\nWith five minutes left in the fight, both fighters were understandably fatigued but also intent on leaving the arena with the title belt. <<|needle|>>Gustafsson started strong, but two minutes in, Jones finally got his takedown. <<|needle|>>But as he pushed Gustafsson to the fence, the Swede rose to his feet and gotloose. <<|needle|>>Jones scored with kicks as an exhausted Gustafsson moved forward, but missed with a spinning elbow. <<|needle|>>A left high kick hit the mark though, responded to seconds later by a spinning back elbow from Gustafsson. <<|needle|>>A vicious left kick to the head by Jones barely moved Gustafsson but he kept the pressure on, scoring with more strikes to the head and body that may have just sealed the deal for him as the final horn sounded.\n\nWatch the replay of tonight’s event on UFC.TVI’ve been a big fan of the Ace Combat series for many years now, dating back to Ace Combat

installment in the franchise, with Namco going off on several desperate tangents to add something new the aging flight combat game design; none of which was met with any real enthusiasm or critical acclaim. <<|needle|>> Namco gets back to basics with Skies Unknown yet still manages to toss in a few new concepts to keep things fresh and for the first time, take advantage of the current-gen hardware…sort of.Structurally, the game runs two parallel stories; one dealing with a young female pilot prodigy who gets tossed in a military prison for flying in a restricted zone, and the other dealing with an ace pilot (you) that gets tossed in that same military prison for a friendly fire incident. <<|needle|>> The stories never truly converge in any meaningful way, as you are quickly assigned to a squadron of prisoner pilots sent out on random missions much like an aerial A-Team. <<|needle|>> Eventually, you’ll prove yourself so invaluable that you are absorbed back into the military as the war between Erusea and Usean rages on.\n\nThere is a lot of story packed into Skies Unknown with the occasional lengthy cutscene along with detailed missions briefs and debriefs complete with tactical screens, battle maps, and lots of futuristic data displays adding gravitas to the actual gameplay. <<|needle|>> Thankfully, all of these are skippable when you return to replay the campaign or select missions later.<image>I’ve always considered myself pretty good at the Ace Combat games, so I instinctively chose the Normal skill level fully knowing that you cannot change this mid-campaign, but I was confident that wouldn’t be an issue. <<|needle|>> Imagine my surprise upon reaching Mission 6, the first Annihilation Battle, and finding I was unable to win/complete that mission after three days (roughly seven hours) of repeated attempts. <<|needle|>> The mission not only had a time limit, it also required you to destroy enough targets of varied value to reach a certain total score. <<|needle|>> In the 20-30 attempts at this mission I could either not reach the score goal within the allotted time, or I would run out of ammo, or I would get shot down. <<|needle|>> My only option other than rage-quitting the game entirely was to restart the campaign from scratch on Easy. <<|needle|>> This led to several revealing discoveries.\n\nFirst, your mission earnings carry over as well as any previously purchased planes and upgrades on the new Aircraft tech tree; a massive flowchart of linear unlockable items ranging from planes to plane upgrades to secondary weapons and perk slots like damage modifiers and even an auto-repair for your plane. <<|needle|>> The game was insultingly easy on the Easy mode – planes go down with a single missile hit – and I even got past Mission 6 on my first try with time to spare, and it wouldn’t be until Mission 11 where I would encounter a similar choke point with the exact same mission type only at sea.I’ve come to learn that there may be a bit of grinding involved in the way Namco has designed Ace Combat 7. <<|needle|>> Many of the more difficult ground assault missions are considerable easier once you have unlocked the A-10 that can withstand crazy amounts of damage and carpet bomb an entire continent. <<|needle|>> Unlocked tree items for improved speed, handling, and weapon reload times also greatly affect the built-in difficulty of the game. <<|needle|>> What really bothered me was the fact that the combat never got any harder; it was just the impossible conditions of success that were frustrating. <<|needle|>> In a mission where you must score 20,000 points in 18 minutes you are forced to do a lot of selective targeting to find high-scoring things to blow up, and targeting while under near-constant missile lock gets very annoying. <<|needle|>> And don’t count on your AI squadron to help.\n\nWhen the game wasn’t pissing me off I did enjoy most all of the other missions that featured the usual Ace Combat assortment of mission types and locations. <<|needle|>> You had the nighttime mission avoiding searchlights, the sea battles, the canyon runs, the weaving through radar patches, the staying under cloud cover, etc. <<|needle|>> It’s all the same stuff we’ve played in past games with some better looking graphics and an interactive weather system that directly impacts your gameplay.Clouds are the new big deal in Ace Combat 7, as they are no longer just part of the skybox but rather real-time volumetric formations you can use to disrupt radar and weapons lock, impact enemy visibility, and potentially even ice up your aircraft. <<|needle|>> You also have thunderstorms where lightning strikes can short out your HUD and there are wind gusts that will blow you off course. <<|needle|>> Clouds and weather play an important part in the game and add that extra notch of realism to what is still a rather arcade flight system.\n\nAce Combat 7 looks impressive compared to previous installments in the franchise, but there is a total lack of support for Xbox X enhancements including 4K and HDR support. <<|needle|>> The game runs at a near-consistent 60fps at 1080p with only a few dips into the mid-50’s under stress, but it also begs the question why the clearly more powerful Xbox One X is being beaten in performance by the PS4 Pro, which also doesn’t run 4K but offers a solid 60fps as well as VR support for three custom missions. <<|needle|>> Japanese developers are clearly still favoring the PS4 when it comes to multi-platform development to the point of not even bothering to optimize for a clearly superior system. <<|needle|>> Those wanting true 4K support and hopefully wider aspect ratios will need to wait for the PC version coming in February.The campaign should take around 8-10 hours to complete assuming you don’t get stuck on Mission 6 for three days and stubbornly beat your head against the wall. <<|needle|>> It’s clear there is a lot of replayability just in earning enough credits to unlock all the planes and tech upgrades in the Aircraft Tree then going back and replaying those mission with new and more powerful planes. <<|needle|>> There is also the obligatory multiplayer component for Ace Combat 7 featuring two primary game modes; Team Deathmatch and Battle Royal, which will provide as many hours of extended gameplay as you choose to invest. <<|needle|>> It is pretty fun and the matchmaking seems surprisingly fair most of the time.\n\nAt its core not much has changed with Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown. <<|needle|>> You still fly around in loops and circles trying to get a target lock then double-tap your missiles and hope the enemy doesn’t evade. <<|needle|>> There is no true dogfighting; at least with guns, but the ground and sea assault missions provide just enough variety to keep things fresh. <<|needle|>> The story is great (the first time), and the Tom Clancy-style mission control ambience is spot-on. <<|needle|>> The voice acting is great in both mission and com chatter and the orchestral score with chanting chorus ranges from chilling to thrilling to almost haunting at times – truly one of the best soundtracks of any Ace Combat game to date.There haven’t been a lot of flight combat games on console or PC lately; certainly nothing of this caliber, so whether you are a veteran of the franchise or a rookie feeling the need for speed, you definitely want to play Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown. <<|needle|>> If you have a choice the superior PS4 version would be my recommendation; especially if you have a PSVR, and if you have a high-end gaming PC and want the ultimate in realism with the best assortment of flight sticks and HOTAS options, wait for PC. <<|needle|>> Hopefully the Xbox One version will see an optimization patch soon to make this version run as good as it should.IndyQ&A: How City of Las Vegas uses TikTok and other social media to better connect with residents – The Nevada IndependentSince 1999, David Riggleman has been the communications director for the City of Las Vegas, and he has had to adapt to the growth of social media.\n\nThe city has more than half a million followers on all of the platforms. <<|needle|>>The city has published videos detailing everything from a day in the life of the mayor to an inside look at just how big the city's traffic signals are.\n\nThe city's social media platforms average about 350 messages a day, about 11,000 a month, with questions about resources and services, which his team of four answers daily, even on weekends, to keep cultivating the relationship with the audience.\n\nThe city's television channel, internet content, marketing and advertising, city publications and emergency communications are all overseen by the same person.\n\nHe talked to The Nevada Independent about his role, what it was like behind the scenes, and the importance of local government's online presence. <<|needle|>>The following questions have been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nWhat was it like to see the city grow so much over the course of 23 years?\n\nI wasn't sure how social media would fit into the city's communications plan. <<|needle|>>I wondered if it was a fad or something else. <<|needle|>>People are going to post what they have for lunch on this site. <<|needle|>>Where did they go on their break? Was it going to be more substantive?\n\nWhen I was younger, we were going to have a neighborhood meeting and come to find out that about 300 people were going to attend because they were worried about noise in the area. <<|needle|>>We were completely oblivious to the fact that there were 300 people talking. <<|needle|>>We didn't participate in that conversation.\n\nI decided that we need to change this. <<|needle|>>If the community is having a discussion, then the city needs to be involved. <<|needle|>>That was a wake up call to me. <<|needle|>>It's not just what you had for lunch that's social media. <<|needle|>>It is the way people communicate and we are going to communicate in the future and that is exactly what has happened.\n\nThe local government needs to have a presence on social media.\n\nIf you're trying to find out accurate, timely information about something going on, the safest place to go would be your social media platforms. <<|needle|>>Initially, we were trying to make sure that people understood about social distance, and then it was time to wear masks and get vaccines. <<|needle|>>The ability to communicate quickly and accurately on social media is going to be important in protecting the community in the event of a major crisis.\n\nOne of the benefits of social media is that it shows that people who work in government and city government are the same as everyone else. <<|needle|>>People come to work every day. <<|needle|>>They're working well. <<|needle|>>It helps humanize the people that work here. <<|needle|>>People see that the people working here are similar to them, and that helps build a strong bond with the community.\n\nLas Vegas is an interesting place to visit. <<|needle|>>The entertainment capital of the world, we have a strong city government that tries to serve the community. <<|needle|>>If there's a new feature in the downtown, a new property that's doing something exciting, we want to be part of that and highlight it, so we try to blend the posts.\n\nHow do you deal with a lot of people?\n\nOne of the advantages of being Las Vegas is that people around the world are going to be interested in what we have to offer, but we also have a large following with local people.\n\nAbout 11,000 messages a month are received by us. <<|needle|>>People used to send you an email when you picked up the phone. <<|needle|>>I'm proud of my team because we try to be responsive and we are responsive seven days a week. <<|needle|>>We're not going to wait until Monday to give you the details about the festival if someone has a question about it. <<|needle|>>We are going to reply that weekend if you have a question. <<|needle|>>We've made a commitment.\n\nWhen you do that, you set the expectation that someone will respond. <<|needle|>>We wanted to build that credibility with the public. <<|needle|>>We didn't want to be seen as being responsive when we were not.\n\nPeople are trying to find things. <<|needle|>>We might direct them to where they can find the information if they inquired and went to the wrong place. <<|needle|>>People who are newer to the area think that everything is in Las Vegas. <<|needle|>>So much of it is in the county. <<|needle|>>There are a lot of questions about what goes on in the city, like how to sign up your child for swim classes or when the next pickleball tournament will be.\n\nHow have you learned to use the algorithm to your advantage?\n\nYou have to be patient with it. <<|needle|>>You have to keep an eye on the data. <<|needle|>>You're going to see what you're posting immediately if it's successful or not.\n\nYou can use analytic tools to help map out where you want to go. <<|needle|>>It helps you understand what people are watching. <<|needle|>>Audiences are different on each of the platforms we're on.\n\nYou have to pay attention to the analytics because it will tell you how things are adjusting to the changes in the algorithm. <<|needle|>>We're going to have to adjust again to stay in step with the way communication is moving after you hit the sweet spot. <<|needle|>>The nature of social media makes that happen. <<|needle|>>It can be a challenge because it is always changing.\n\nWhat is the future for the city's social media?\n\nCommunications evolved to where they are. <<|needle|>>I have embraced the change and have been happy. <<|needle|>>We used to distribute information, but we were criticized for not being very responsive. <<|needle|>>Sending a message on the website or picking up the phone weren't the most convenient ways to do it With social media, we can have a dialogue with the people who live in Las Vegas and the world. <<|needle|>>That has been great.\n\nI went to a seminar about TikTok and was told that it was going to be a force that would have to be reckon with. <<|needle|>>The 800-pound gorilla is in the room and you can dismiss it. <<|needle|>>And I paid attention.\n\nThe question is what the future will look like. <<|needle|>>It's going to be difficult. <<|needle|>>We try to keep our eyes on that. <<|needle|>>I think one of the things that we're hearing a lot about is the Metaverse, where people can come into the city virtually and have their avatars walk around City Hall and they can do it from their own home. <<|needle|>>They don't have to leave their couch to go to a council meeting.\n\nThe idea of the Metaverse and giving people a virtual look inside places is going to be a very strong direction for social media.\n\nThose things start off as a fad, but then someone comes up with a way to use them. <<|needle|>>TikTok was going to be a good way to communicate government information. <<|needle|>>It is. <<|needle|>>I believe the Metaverse will be the same. <<|needle|>>People will figure out how to use it in a practical way. <<|needle|>>It's not just a game. <<|needle|>>It will be helpful to be able to interact with the city or pay a bill.Will ChatGPT take my job? Experts reveal the five professions at most risk from ..\n\nHow stars like Dolly Parton and Tom Hanks become so beloved\n\nI tried using ChatGPT to write this article<image>Gen Z is using TikTok as a search engine. <<|needle|>>Is this the end of Google?A third of the region’s 3000ha of vineyards are within the fire scar with about 500ha of vines across 60 vineyards sustaining damage.\n\nRosback said the use of GPS technology allowed his 15ha vineyard to be quickly assessed to determine which vines had sustained burnt trunks, scorched canopies and the severity of damage. <<|needle|>>It also mapped the location of burnt posts and irrigation damage.\n\nAbout 15 kilometres of irrigation tube and 1450 posts have been replaced on the property and a further 45km of irrigation repaired. <<|needle|>>Up to 90 per cent of the vineyard’s vines  sustained canopy scorch. <<|needle|>>Although three of the four blocks had trunk burn rates of less than 5 per cent, 60 per cent of vines in the largest block on the property had burnt trunks, prompting Rosback to take drastic action.A GPS map showing canopy damage to individual vines on one of Charles Rosback’s Chardonnay blocks.\n\nThis week, volunteers and GLOG Viticulture staff have used the company’s Maxicut system, usually used in winter to cut away trunks suffering Eutypa dieback, to cut trunks off just a few centimetres from the ground across the entire block.\n\nRosback said the action needed to be taken immediately to give new shoots the best possible chance to be trained into replacement trunks before the end of the growing season in April. <<|needle|>>The use of the GPS technology was crucial in quickly identifying the areas needing to be cut back, he said.\n\nRosback is hoping the new vines will return to about 60-80 per cent production next year and will be back to full yields in 2022.\n\nGlog Viticulture Business Development Manager Martha Valkenburg was working at a Balhannah vineyard in 2009 when a bushfire went through and has used her experience to develop the strategy.\n\n“From Martha’s previous experience from a fire 11 years ago we knew that those vines that had been burnt on the trunks, they needed to be cut down to an inch off the ground to get rid of that dead or damaged wood so we can grow a new trunk,” Rosback said.\n\n“By cutting it down you are allowing a new trunk to grow that will be healthy and will have full sap flow.Charles Rosback inpects a new vine shoot emerging from the base of a severed vine trunk.\n\n“We’ve already got customers asking us to provide this service and we’ve got equipment going out. <<|needle|>>We’ll probably do five or six vineyards in the immediate future and that will also reduce the pruning burden in the winter.”\n\nThe adapted Maxicut system, which is essentially a duel set of high-powered vineshears run off a tractor’s hydraulic system, can work through about 500 metres of vines in an hour.\n\nThe trial will compare results between the entire block being cut with other blocks on the property where single rows or individual vines are being cut and other vines that are left to recover with minimal intervention.\n\nRosback held a field day at the vineyard yesterday (Tuesday 14/1) to show other growers what they had done.\n\n“Some people will make the decision to cut their vines down in winter and they’ll grow a new vine next summer but this will delay fruit production,” Rosback said.\n\n“What we’re doing is acting now with the intent of growing a crop next summer so our recovery process and our cash flow implications are minimised by taking action.”Many of the fire affected vines have reshot, giving them a green appearance despite having scorched fruit and burnt trunks.\n\nLong-time Adelaide Hills grape growing expert and Hamilton Viticulture consultant Richard Hamilton said his advice to fire affected growers was to get irrigation back on immediately and then wait 6-8 weeks to see how vines responded.\n\n“It’s a lot of work to cut it back, why not let the vine do its own thing and you might get the same outcome,” he said.\n\n“We don’t actually have a lot of information on that so the couple of growers trialling it will be able to provide some answers but what we’re looking for is maximum leaf growth as soon as possible because the vines have got very little reserves at the moment.”\n\nAlthough sometimes overshadowed by the Barossa just to the north and McLaren Vale to the south, the Adelaide Hills has emerged as one of Australia’s leading cool-climate wine regions and is home to more than 100 wine producers and almost 300 vineyards.\n\nThis year’s harvest is expected to begin next month and continue into March and possibly April for growers who still have healthy fruit to pick.\n\nSeveral grower meetings have been held in the Adelaide Hills since the fires to answer questions and help build solidarity among affected growers.Glog Viticulture has adapted its Maxicut vineshears to cut off burnt vine trunks.\n\nGumeracha winery Mt Bera Vineyards suffered significant damage to its 75ha property in the Sampson Flat Bushfire in January 2015. <<|needle|>>Last month’s fire came within 50 metres of the property again but did not burn any vines.\n\nMt Bera owner Greg Horner has attended two of the recent grower meetings where he has spoken about his experiences of repairing a fire-ravaged vineyard.\n\nHe has also started a blog on the winery’s website as a reference for other growers and to provide hope that recovery is possible.\n\nHorner has visited a handful of fire-affected vineyards in the past few weeks.\n\nHe said a lack of appropriate machinery and funds forced him to wait until winter pruning to train his replacement trunks but he saw merit in Rosback’s strategy.\n\n“You’ve got to balance out action with getting a crop as soon as possible – if the vines aren’t that badly burnt you’re probably better off to wait,” Horner said.\n\n“They are two weeks earlier than our fire, the season is probably a week later as well so they’ve probably got three weeks up their sleeves. <<|needle|>>If they can go through and do training passes and get the shoots up to the wire then they could easily get a crop next year.\n\n“I’m just trying to help people because there’s so little information around. <<|needle|>>I don’t think that most people realise that when the vines burn on the top they are still very-much alive underground.”The security camera system at the Melbourne Cricket Ground is being progressively upgraded from the old analogue equipment to digital cameras on an IP network.\n\nHaving made the decision to go IP, \"a very vigorous review\" of the available products was undertaken, including a side-by-side shootout of competing cameras and software, said Andy Frances, the Melbourne Cricket Club's manager, security and venue support.\n\nThat process resulted in the selection of Axis cameras and Genetec's Omnicast software.\n\nRather than adopting a wholesale rip and replace upgrade, the MCC chose to progressively replace the old Panasonic analogue cameras as they fail, moving the remainder around so that the new equipment is installed in entire zones at a time. <<|needle|>>At this stage, around 15% of the cameras are digital, with around 50 more Axis cameras to be installed in the next few weeks.\n\nThere are 480 cameras around the stadium, and the $A3 million project is expected to be completed in another four to five years.The upgrade included the rollout of a fibre optic network and the construction of a new security control room, which has now been in action around the clock for about a year. <<|needle|>>On match days, operations are run from a second control room overlooking the ground from above the members' enclosure.\n\nThe IT department was involved from the start - see page 2.\n\nFrances noted that the MCC's IT department was involved in the project from the start, and are responsible for managing the 70TB of IBM storage used by the surveillance system. <<|needle|>>Since IT staff work on match days, any problems that arise are usually fixed immediately, he said.\n\nThe next phase of the upgrade will be to add touchscreen navigation to Omnicast, allowing security officers to drill down to specific camera views  without using a mouse or keyboard, and even follow an individual around the premises by touching the screen.The Club is planning to equip guards with iPhones or iPod touches so they can wirelessly receive still images or video clips to help identify troublemakers in the crowd, and to show to police if necessary. <<|needle|>>\"Wi-Fi coverage here is very good,\" said Frances, with Internode providing free access for patrons on match days.\n\nFrances said the Genetec software 'understands' the seating plan so the control room can easily zoom into a particular seat. <<|needle|>>Patrons are encouraged to report offensive behaviour via SMS.\n\nThis capability is expected to be deployed in time for the Ashes tour this summer. <<|needle|>>\"We'll have some big crowds this year, so it'll be great,\" said Frances.\n\nWhat else is planned? See page 3.\n\nA further extension would be to give mobile guards remote access to the camera system from a portable device.\n\nThe surveillance system is being expanded to cover the Club's other premises, including the bowls club at Hawthorn. <<|needle|>>These other locations will be monitored from the main MCG control room.\n\nVideo analytics may be used for security and congestion purposes. <<|needle|>>The Club has experimented with 'unattended package' alerts, and is also considering the installation of megapixel cameras at each entry point for use in conjunction with face recognition.Frances said the video recordings are kept for 28 days in line with legislative requirements, and are only released to the club's insurers, the police, or in response to a summons.\n\nMore in this category: « WikiLeaks targets the Afghanistan conflict; would the Filter block this?

Your tip will be anonymous<image>It took me a bit longer than usual to get to Crimson Peak. <<|needle|>>I am a big del Toro fan, especially the super-fun Hellboy installments, the haunting Pan’s Labyrinth, and the TV series The Strain (based on novels written by del Toro and Chuck Hogan). <<|needle|>>I’d read mixed reviews of Crimson Peak, and other movies always seemed to take precedent, so I’m a bit late for this one.\n\nPremise: a young woman is swept off her feet by a handsome man and taken to his gothic mansion that sits atop a mountain of red clay. <<|needle|>>Sinister goings-on reveal a terrible (SPOILER! Lannister-esque) secret and she wonders if she will leave Crimson Peak alive.\n\nI noted that most of the critical reviews of Crimson Peak mentioned that the movie was inaccurately billed as a ghost-centric horror movie but behaves more as a gothic bodice-clutcher.\n\nI agree with that assessment. <<|needle|>>Stylish and bloody, but not particularly scary. <<|needle|>>It’s got plenty of tropes, a conventional plot line, and melodramatic woes, but there’s not a disturbing bone in the mix.\n\nDel Toro never fails to deliver a visually stunning film. <<|needle|>>Crimson Peak is beautiful to watch. <<|needle|>>The ethereal Wasikowska is lovely and Tom Hiddleston by turns devastatingly handsome and creepy. <<|needle|>>The costumes are beautiful and the sets intricate and detailed. <<|needle|>>Del Toro also clearly paid attention to events during the time the story is set, from a cholera epidemic to a Mary Shelley reference.\n\nDespite the eye candy, this movie focuses more on the interpersonal dynamics than the horror elements. <<|needle|>>I think it would have only taken a few shifts in perspective to make this more of a horror story. <<|needle|>>One character is slowly poisoned by another, but it almost feels as if the poisoning is an afterthought (not to mention so predictable).\n\nBottom line: see it for the pretty pictures, but don’t expect to have trouble sleeping.\n\nIt’s been a little while I’ve done a movie review. <<|needle|>>I certainly haven’t stopped watching them, and I take notes, but I haven’t written up a review.\n\nA little while ago I watched the 2010 movie Frozen, directed by Adam Greene. <<|needle|>>It took a little more suspension of disbelief than usual, but I enjoyed it. <<|needle|>>My husband, who is an avid outdoorsman, couldn’t suspend disbelief quite the same way I could, and he picked this one apart from beginning to end.Frozen stars Kevin Zegers, Emma Bell, and the ever-enjoyable Shawn Ashmore (X-Men and the TV mini-series Earthsea. <<|needle|>>He played Ged. <<|needle|>>I was not impressed.). <<|needle|>>The basic premise is pretty simple: three friends don’t pay for lift tickets at a ski resort and are thus unaccounted for when the lift shuts down for the night… on a Sunday… when the resort is scheduled to be closed for the week. <<|needle|>>They’re stuck on a lift way up high in subzero temps with no way to get down and no rescue in sight.\n\nSome problems we had (or he had… like I said, I was good to play along without too much complaint):\n\nI can make some comparisons to the 2003 movie Open Water. <<|needle|>>Abandonment, struggle for survival against nature, fairly small perspective. <<|needle|>>If you didn’t like Open Water, you’re safe knowing that you probably won’t care for Frozen.\n\nI recommend this as a weekend time waster just for the entertainment value.Wow… this one took even my jaded sensibilities by surprise.\n\nAlyce Kills is a 2013 release, directed by Jay Lee, of Zombie Strippers and The Slaughter fame. <<|needle|>>This is the story of a young woman, Alyce, and her descent into madness.\n\nAlyce is a rather unhappy chick. <<|needle|>>She works for a woman who resents her and likes nasty little passive-aggressive games. <<|needle|>>Alyce’s love for her best friend, Carroll, is painfully apparent but unrequited. <<|needle|>>The girls spend an evening together bonding, despite past tensions over what is apparently Alyce’s tendency to lapse into “single white female” obsessiveness. <<|needle|>>All the fun things are present: red velvet cake, plans for vengeance upon a cheating ex, and almost-but-not-quite lesbian action. <<|needle|>>This scene brings to the forefront Alyce’s feelings for Carroll and Carroll’s dismissal.\n\nAfter the girls visit their drug dealer and score some Ecstasy, they return to Alyce’s apartment and go to the roof where Alyce (accidentally?) pushes Carroll off the roof. <<|needle|>>Alyce begins to lose her mind and Carroll’s apparition (can’t be ghost, because Carroll doesn’t die immediately) visits Alyce in her home. <<|needle|>>Alyce turns to more drugs, which she trades sex for, to assuage her pain, but the drugs seem to only fuel her own dive into psychosis. <<|needle|>>After Carroll’s eventual death, Alyce attends the funeral, only to be thrown out for molesting the corpse… in front of all the funeral-goers. <<|needle|>>I’m not sure why this scene tickled me so much… but it did. <<|needle|>>Something new is always good. <<|needle|>>She’s clearly out of control and when she finally decides to take back her life… she’s so creative.\n\nThe story is a good one and I enjoyed the movie immensely. <<|needle|>>I was surprised at how quickly it turned into a gorefest after a really satisfying slow burn, and it’s so gory it’s almost gratuitous, but I’ll forgive Lee for this because of the creativity with which Alyce goes about her revenge.\n\nRecommended for horror fans and those who like chick flicks with a twist (and can handle a good blender scene).\n\nI’m always intrigued by movies that claim to be based on actual events, particularly horror movies. <<|needle|>>Most of the horrific things we write about are so far out there it’s unreasonable to assume they’d actually happen. <<|needle|>>For a movie to bill itself as real horror is fascinating to me.\n\nI was trolling Amazon rentals for something different to watch one night last month and found this one:This is a 2013 movie directed by Renny Harlin. <<|needle|>>The basic premise is straightforward: a group of teenagers read about the “Dyatlov Pass Incident,” which is a real event, and go to investigate.\n\nThe Dyatlov Pass Incident refers to the disappearance of nine skiers in the Ural mountains in 1959. <<|needle|>>When an expected message from the group of experienced skiers did not arrive, search and rescue went after them. <<|needle|>>They were found dead, in various stated of undress (in below zero temps), with tents ripped open from the inside, and some had fatal wounds that could not be explained. <<|needle|>>Several of them left the camp barefoot, and radiation in the area was unusually high. <<|needle|>>Their deaths have never been explained. <<|needle|>>Really fascinating stuff, and certainly could be the basis for a real life horror. <<|needle|>>If you’re interested in reading more about this event, I found a good article here.\n\nIn the movie Devil’s Pass, Harlin puts his own spin on what might have happened to the original skiers. <<|needle|>>A group of American college students, interested in the original incident, decide to hike the same path as the party from 1956. <<|needle|>>As you can imagine, Harlin puts forth his own dramatized theory of what might have taken place in February, 1956. <<|needle|>>The cast is mostly newcomers, no big-ticket actors, and they do a good job. <<|needle|>>There’s a good slow burn up to a certain point, after which you have to let go of the “true story” part and just run with it. <<|needle|>>I had a brief outburst of “WHY??? WHY’D HAVE TO GO THERE???” and then just settled in and enjoyed the end. <<|needle|>>It was suspenseful, if not believable.\n\nI give it three and a half stars. <<|needle|>>I had to take one and a half off because of the ending. <<|needle|>>I would have preferred a plausible idea to what might have happened to the skiers, but on it’s own this is a fun movie.\n\nI can’t figure out how I missed this gem. <<|needle|>>This movie takes the most cliched tropes of the horror film genre and turns them upside-down, with hysterical and– dare I say it?– heartwarming results. <<|needle|>>It’s both a celebration and a parody of genre conventions.\n\nDale and Tucker, my heroes\n\nTucker and Dale vs. <<|needle|>>Evil is a 2010 film. <<|needle|>>A favorite actor of mine, Alan Tudyk, plays one of the title characters, Tucker. <<|needle|>>I may have overlooked this film when browsing the Amazon streaming videos, but Tudyk’s name caught my eye.\n\nTucker and Dale vs. <<|needle|>>Evil is set in Appalachia, West Virginia. <<|needle|>>Being from Pennsylvania, and more recently having spent the last 16 years in southwestern Pennsylvania, I’ve heard all the West Virginia jokes, and knew this would come into play somehow, most likely with the hillbilly killers terrorizing innocent non-hillbillies. <<|needle|>>What surprised me was that the typical horror stereotypes were solidly reversed in this movie. <<|needle|>>Another surprise in store for me was the humor.\n\nThis movie begins with a carful of college preppies heading into the woods of West Virginia for some camping. <<|needle|>>The stereotypes come fast and quick– they forgot the beer, the sorority girls are both blonde and wearing stripper shoes, the frat boys are handsome in their pastel polo shirts.\n\nWe meet Tucker and Dale, our two hillbillies in overalls who’ve bought a “vacation home” in the woods and happen to be at the gas station where the kids stop for beer. <<|needle|>>Dale immediately proclaims his admiration for Allison, one of the girls in the party, and after Tucker encourages him to talk with her– complete with scythe and maniacal laugh– the kids run from our hillbilly heroes.\n\nWe see the “vacation home,” which amounts to no more than a run-down cabin apparently used by a serial killer. <<|needle|>>My husband pointed out a resemblance to the cabin from the horror classic Evil Dead. <<|needle|>>One poorly timed coincidence after another and Allison ends up in the cabin with Tucker and Dale, after Dale saves her from a near drowning.\n\nWhile Dale woos Allison with pancakes and Trivial Pursuit, the college kids forge a plan to save their “kidnapped” friend, and in doing so, seal their own demise at their own hands. <<|needle|>>Tucker and Dale are convinced the college kids came to the woods to carry our a suicide pact. <<|needle|>>Law enforcement gets involved, until structural issues with the cabin take care of the officer. <<|needle|>>Hysterical action follows, lots of gore– there’s a wood chipper death! — and Earl Grey tea. <<|needle|>>I know, right? I loved it.\n\nI was not surprised by the amount of gore in the movie– it’s labeled a horror, after all– but I was surprised at the lack of profanity and nudity. <<|needle|>>If it weren’t for the copious bodily fluid splattering, I’d almost think I could show this to my kids. <<|needle|>>This is campy horror at it’s finest.Geek movie and TV news is pouring in, and we round it up here.Marvel Studios has released a poster and trailer for Eternals, which will premiere in the U.S. <<|needle|>>on November 5. <<|needle|>> Other than a short clip in a sizzle reel early this month (see \"Marvel Movie Sizzle Reel Reveals Footage\"), this is the first footage of the film released to the public.The CW has given an update on new series in development. <<|needle|>> Naomi, which got a pilot order earlier this year (see \"The CW Orders ‘Naomi,’ ‘Powerpuff Girls’\"), is now going to series, Variety reports. <<|needle|>> The DC-based series is developed by Ava Duvernay and Jill Blankenship, and will star Kaci Walfall.\n\nOther new geek series were not as lucky. <<|needle|>> The network ordered a pilot for Powerpuff Girls at the same time as the Naomi pilot, but now wants to rework it with the same cast and team and film a new pilot, according to the report. <<|needle|>> Tom Swift, introduced in an episode of Nancy Drew, remains in development; while the Black Lightning spinoff series Painkiller (see \"’Black Lightning’ Ending\") is not.\n\nHenry Cavill is in talks to play a leading role in an upcoming reboot of Highlander, according to Deadline. <<|needle|>> The new Lionsgate feature will be directed by John Wick director Chad Stahelski and written by Kerry Williamson. <<|needle|>> Stahelski has been attached to the project since 2016 (see \"’Highlander’\").\n\nThe long-gestating Batgirl feature has found directors in Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, who directed Bad Boys for Life, according to Hollywood Reporter. <<|needle|>> Christina Hodson was assigned to write back in 2018 (see \"’Batgirl’ Finds Woman Screenwriter\"). <<|needle|>> Originally planned for theatrical release, Batgirl is now headed to HBO Max.<image>Adam Wingard will direct Hardcore, based on the Image comic created by Robert Kirkman and Mark Silvestri, according to Variety. <<|needle|>> Wingard just had a big hit with Godzilla vs. <<|needle|>>Kong, which is having a successful theatrical run despite Covid restrictions. <<|needle|>> The film will be based on an outline by Kirkman, adapted by Wingard and Will Simmons.\nMORE COMICSRev up for non-stop fun with four of your favorite Disney stories when Disney On Ice presents Worlds of Enchantment comes to Tampa!This one-of-a-kind production is coming to Amalie Arena in Tampa from March 24-26, 2017. <<|needle|>>Tickets are on sale now. <<|needle|>>Get ready to enter a dazzling world of Disney magic, live on ice where Lightning McQueen, Mater and the crew of Disney●Pixar’s Cars perform high-speed stunts and race across the ice like you’ve never seen before!Be amazed and join Ariel as she dives into the underwater kingdom of Disney’s TheLittle Mermaid.Buzz Lightyear, Woody, Jessie and other favorites from the Toy Story gang as they try and escape from Sunnyside Daycare in one of their most daring adventure ever from Disney●Pixar’s Toy Story 3–proving that the toys are back in town!

coming to the center for immunizations at the age of 4, it was the beginning of a lifelong relationship.Fleming’s mother sent him first to the center’s child care, then its after-school programs, then he began volunteering. <<|needle|>>His first paid opportunity came at 14.\n\nOther than his time at college — for which Bethlehem Centers secured him a full scholarship — he’s never really left. <<|needle|>>After a year as interim director, he became the permanent director in 2014.\n\n“The Lord aligned my stars perfectly,” he said. <<|needle|>>“I knew this would be something I wanted to do for a living.”\n\nFleming’s experience is not unique. <<|needle|>>It’s part of what he calls the center’s “womb-to-tomb” mission.\n\nThe long list of programs the center offers includes child care, after-school and teaching programs for K-10, summer vocational programs, recreation and life skills development, as well as an array of activities for seniors, community outreach projects and Meals on Wheels deliveries.\n\nThe Nashville center is celebrating its 127th year, growing out of a partnership between two women, Sallie Hill Sawyer and Estelle Haskins, who sought to impact the lives of others and provide essential services for the working poor.Malachi Carey is a student in the Vocational Success Institute, a summer employment program for youth at Bethlehem Centers of Nashville.

generated by a municipal committee considering ways to help cited the need for community resource centers and youth development among its top priorities.\n\nPrograms like Bethlehem Centers’ Vocational Success Institute aim to reach young teens at an age where they may be susceptible to making bad choices that could derail their future.\n\nMalachi Carey, 16, joined the program at 14, working in the kitchen for Meals on Wheels, serving as a front-desk greeter and helping with children. <<|needle|>>This summer, he worked in the campus community garden.\n\n“This place helped me a lot. <<|needle|>>I used to do bad stuff, used to steal. <<|needle|>>They helped me grow, got me working to earn my own money so I didn’t need to steal,” he said.\n\nCarey said that in the future, he’d like to work with kids and “help them like Mr. <<|needle|>>Steve helped me.”\n\nJanet Reyes is another Bethlehem Centers “alumna” who began participating in children’s programs when she was 5. <<|needle|>>Now, she’s a staff youth specialist who helps tutor kids.\n\nThe center’s Meals on Wheels program serves up to 216 meals five days a week, delivered daily with a smile courtesy of Roy Reed, who has been a delivery driver for Bethlehem Centers since 1996.Not content to just drop off the meals, Reed stays and talks, takes out trash. <<|needle|>>He may even pick up groceries or take mail to the post office.\n\nWhen he was in the 10th grade, Reed was part of the center’s Say Yes to Success program, which guides middle-school students in making positive life choices and developing goals for promising futures.\n\n“The program kept my head on straight,” he said. <<|needle|>>“I grew up in a single-parent home without a father, and Mr. <<|needle|>>Steve is like a father to me.”\n\nPerhaps no one better exhibits the “womb-to-tomb” mission than Yvonne Franklin. <<|needle|>>If not for Bethlehem Centers, she might not have been born: Her parents met there as children.\n\nShe also met her husband when he was serving as a counselor at a camp where Bethlehem Centers held summer programs.\n\nFranklin retired in 2013 and served as a caregiver for her sister. <<|needle|>>After her sister’s passing, Franklin said she was “just sitting at home all day depressed” until someone recommended Bethlehem Centers’ Silver and Gold Senior Club.\n\n“It’s been a blessing. <<|needle|>>Bethlehem Centers was the only thing around here when I was growing up, so I found I already knew half the people here anyway,” she said.\n\n“We’re proud to be part of a ministry connecting people to hope,” Fleming said.\n\nIt’s the sunshine of my day — I get up every morning on fire knowing I’m coming to a place where we spread love, offer hope and help.”Perrin & Rowe appearing in Famous Hotels – The Savoy, The Langham and Claridge’s\n\nWith Perrin & Rowe being a British manufacturer their work has been seen in some of the most iconic hotels in London – The Savoy, The Langham and Claridge’s. <<|needle|>>Because their work became known by architects and design professionals for the quality and durability of the products, they started to appear in these famous hotels.\n\nAs you stay the night in one of these iconic London hotels you will just see how stunning the Perrin & Rowe brassware will fit within your bathroom and kitchen design and provide you with a stunning style for many years to come.\n\nThe Savoy is located on the Northbank of the River Thames, equidistant from the City of London, the world’s financial capital and the likes of Knightsbridge and Mayfair. <<|needle|>>It was the first purpose-built deluxe hotel in London, setting new standards for luxury, comfort and service unheard of in the hotel world of today. <<|needle|>>No other London hotel can rival The Savoy’s superlative location.\n\nIt was known for the magnet of wealthy, famous and glamourous guests, with their stories becoming part of the legend of this truly unique hotel.\n\nBuilt in 1889 by the theatrical impresario Richard D’Oyly Carte the building had no overall architect. <<|needle|>>The exterior was designed to look like a fashionable waterside continental hotel with long rows of balconies running all the way up the façade along the River Front.\n\nThe Savoy has been recognised with many prestigious awards throughout the years, demonstrating the continuous desire to strive for excellence.\n\nWith the famous entrance, there are some of London’s top restaurants and bars inside.<image>The Langham is a modern luxury in the heart of the West End and has over 150 years of heritage, including famous guests and innovations from Europe’s first ‘Grand Hotel’. <<|needle|>>It truly is a London icon, so be prepared to be amazed and whisked away as you enter through the doors and walk into over 150 years of history.\n\nIt opened on June 10th, 1865 with the Prince of Wales attending. <<|needle|>>During the 70s The Langham, London became well-known for its one-of-a-kind indulgences – electric lights, hydraulic lifts, air conditioning and other extraordinary innovations. <<|needle|>>It soon became the favoured venue for royalty, artists and musicians all over the world.\n\nThis particular hotel played a significant role during the war years. <<|needle|>>It served as a local first-aid and military post during World War II.\n\nIn 2009 The Langham unveiled the magnificent results of a five year and £80 million refurbishments that included a stunning new lobby and a dazzling restored Palm Court that was the birthplace for the traditional afternoon tea.Claridge’s is a 5-star luxury hotel in Mayfair from the 1850s where it has always excelled at the finer things in life, such as glamourous design, inspiring dining and impeccable service.\n\nLife started as a single house where it was soon transformed into an art deco masterpiece that was favoured by royalty and the most distinguished figures of every generation.\n\nYou can certainly have an experience at Claridge’s you will never forget. <<|needle|>>Like they say there are many 5-star hotels in London but nowhere quite like Claridge’s.\n\nWilliam and Marianne Claridge ran a hotel in a single house at 51 Brook Street. <<|needle|>>They wanted to expand their business so bought five adjoining buildings in 1854. <<|needle|>>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited in 1860, with the hotel soon becoming a favourite. <<|needle|>>Richard D’Oyly Carte, the owner of the Savoy bought the hotel in 1893, re-designing the building.\n\nThe younger generation of London made Claridge’s their place to party with the ballroom echoing to the songs of Gershwin, the sounds of jazz and the steps of Charleston. <<|needle|>>Eighty new rooms and a stunning ballroom were added.\n\nHollywood stars started to adopt Claridge’s as their London residence. <<|needle|>>Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, Audrey Hepburn, Yul Brynner and Bing Crosby were just some of the guests. <<|needle|>>Fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg began her long relationship with the hotel throughout these years, resulting in her first interiors works being commissioned by the hotel.\n\n1996 saw it have another restoration led by designer Thierry Despont. <<|needle|>>He created Gordon Ramsay at Claridge’s, The Foyer, The Reading Room and The Fumoir. <<|needle|>>Kate Moss celebrated her 30th birthday here, with Jade Jagger and Lulu Guinness describing the hotel as their ultimate treat.\n\n2014 saw Fera open under the Michelin-starred chef Simon Rogan. <<|needle|>>The interior of the restaurant reflects the creative and natural style of the cuisine.\n\n2019, a new restaurant was opened called Davies and Brook. <<|needle|>>It is set in a relaxed yet refined setting, where the restaurant focuses on warm, inviting and engaging hospitality with delicious and beautiful cuisine.If you are looking to add a handmade kitchen to your property to boost the current value and provide

After the trip, these “jokes” continued and I was afraid that Marie would find out about my future proposal plan. <<|needle|>>Marie is a big fan of the movie “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”, Audrey Hepburn, and the famous jewelry chain “Tiffany and Co.” I instantly knew she deserved an engagement ring from Tiffany’s so I began the engagement ring shopping. <<|needle|>>Luckily, through all of her “jokes” about being suspicious of me proposing, she revealed her engagement ring and diamond preferences. <<|needle|>>I found exactly what she wanted, but all I was missing was her ring size. <<|needle|>>After failing to find out her ring size in secret, I made us stop by a mall jewelry store to get our ring sizes just for fun. <<|needle|>>I quickly finalized the engagement ring order and was very happy. <<|needle|>>I began to picture our future life as a married couple and knew Marie was the one for me. <<|needle|>>The proposal planning had just begun. <<|needle|>>One day, I asked Marie’s father, Dan Connole, to lunch. <<|needle|>>I revealed my desire to marry Marie and asked if he could be a part of the surprise proposal. <<|needle|>>It was great to receive his approval and have him as my side-kick while planning the proposal. <<|needle|>>Dan would not reveal the details of our lunch to anyone so everyone became suspicious. <<|needle|>>Family is very important to Marie and me, so I wanted to involve both of our immediate family members for this special moment. <<|needle|>>Hence, Dan and I began to reveal details to our family members (except Marie!) as I finalized my plan to propose to the love of my life. <<|needle|>>Since I had several people involved in the surprise proposal, I created a word document with all of the details such as the proposal date, the location, the nearby parking spots, and lots of pictures. <<|needle|>>I figured it would be easy to have everything detailed in one document. <<|needle|>>I hired Twin Firs Photography to capture the proposal, so the word document was great for them to be informed of the plan as well. <<|needle|>>They were also helpful in providing tips and suggestions to make the surprise proposal a success. <<|needle|>>Marie and I went on a fancy date in Washington D.C to celebrate our anniversary. <<|needle|>>The plan was to eat dinner at the Wharf and then migrate to the Georgetown Waterfront for our sunset boat tour along the Potomac. <<|needle|>>I suggested we arrive early to our boat tour so we could walk along the Georgetown Waterfront Park. <<|needle|>>Our family members and friends from Twin Firs Photography were hiding behind bushes at the Georgetown Waterfront Park the whole time! As we were walking towards a specific section of the park, our family members came out and revealed signs that spelled out “Marie, will you marry me?” I quickly got down on one knee and proposed, as Twin Firs Photography captured the beautiful moment. <<|needle|>>After the proposal, Marie and I left our family and had a romantic sunset boat tour. <<|needle|>>When we got home, we popped champagne

Friends and Family, ChristmasTelevision in Israel refers to television broadcasting services in the State of Israel, inaugurated on March 24, 1966. <<|needle|>>Initially, there was one state-owned channel. <<|needle|>>In 1986, a second state-regulated channel was launched. <<|needle|>>This channel became a state-regulated commercial channel in 1993. <<|needle|>>An additional commercial channel was introduced in 2002, followed by the introduction of two commercial niche channels: an Israeli Russian-speaking channel (in 2002) and a channel of Israeli popular music (in 2003). <<|needle|>>Colour transmissions were introduced gradually around 1980. <<|needle|>>Satellite-based multichannel service has been available since 2000.Television in Israel was introduced in 1966 with the first transmission of the Israeli Educational Television, using black-and-white television technology,[1] intended to be received by 32 schools, in attempt to use television as an instructional tool. <<|needle|>>[2] The Israeli Broadcasting Authority launched regular public transmissions on 2 May 1968, on the occasion of Israeli Independence Day. <<|needle|>>Until 1986 Israel had only one television channel shared by IETV and IBA. <<|needle|>>Experimental transmissions on a second channel started in October 1986 and expanded gradually.Israeli television started to operate when American and European stations started to switch to full-scale colour transmissions. <<|needle|>>Nevertheless, the new state-controlled Israeli stations were equipped with black and white facilities as they were cheaper, and as colour productions were deemed unnecessary. <<|needle|>>Arnon Zuckerman, the IBA director general from 1973 to March 1979, cites Golda Meir (Israel's Prime Minister 1969-1974) saying about colour television, \"It is so artificial, I know it from America. <<|needle|>>There is no need for this\"[3]. <<|needle|>>During the mid-seventies black and white equipment became rare, so any damaged piece of equipment (VCRs, telecines etc.) had to be replaced with a colour-enabled facility.\n\nAccording to Yair Lapid's biographical book about his father, Tommy Lapid, who was the IBA director general from April 1979 to March 1984, the IBA had the necessary equipment for filming and broadcasting in colour for nearly a decade before putting it into use; however the introduction of colour transmissions was halted due to political pressure and threats of industrial actions.[4]\n\nOwing to this state of affairs, newscasts and other regular productions were filmed using black and white cameras; however many special productions ordered from private Israeli studios (in particular the Herzliya Studios) were filmed and taped in colour. <<|needle|>>Furthermore, the Israeli television used to buy many TV series and movies from American and British TV stations (broadcast with Hebrew-Arabic subtitles). <<|needle|>>The result was a mixture of colour and black and white broadcasts, which encouraged traders to import colour TV sets, especially as TV stations in neighbouring Jordan and Egypt started colour transmissions in 1974.\n\nThe Israeli government frowned upon the increasing import of colour TV sets, which it considered a threat to Israeli economic stability and an improper pursuit of luxury, which allegedly increased social gaps. <<|needle|>>Therefore, the government ordered IBA and IETV to broadcast entirely in black and white and erase the colour from any colour-taped telecast. <<|needle|>>Technically, this was done by erasing the \"burst phase\" signal. <<|needle|>>The \"damaged\" signal triggered the \"colour killer\" mechanism, which is installed in colour TV sets in order to prevent the appearance of incidental colour spots on the screen when black-and-white films are broadcast or when the reception is disturbed.\n\nThis method was named mekhikon (Hebrew: מחיקון‎ \"eraser\"), and soon after its introduction, special TV sets with an anti-mekhikon (Hebrew: אנטי-מחיקון‎ \"anti-eraser\") device were offered. <<|needle|>>This device reinstalled the burst phase signal according to several known standards. <<|needle|>>The client had to turn a switch until the pictures on the screen appeared in natural colours. <<|needle|>>According to a report in Yediot Aharonoth from January 1979[5] The client had to manipulate the switch every 15 minutes on average in normal conditions, or up to 10 times an hour when special problems occurred, in order to restore natural colours or if the picture suddenly turned black and white.\n\nBased on information retrieved from owners of electricity appliance stores, the aforementioned report estimated that 90% of those who bought colour TV sets also bought the anti-mekhikon device, whose price ranged between 2,500 and 4,000 Israeli lirot (the TV set itself cost 40-50 thousand lirot[6].\n\nThe Israeli government had to allow undisrupted colour transmissions by the IBA in two occasions. <<|needle|>>In November 1977 the IBA had to cover live and in colour the historical visit of the Egyptian president, Anwar El Sadat, to Israel, as this transmission was sent via satellite to stations around the world. <<|needle|>>In March 1979 the IBA hosted the annual Eurovision Song Contest, and once again had to send the transmission live in colour to stations around the world.\n\nEventually, the mekhikon idea was proven futile, and the Israeli television abandoned its use gradually at the end of 1979, allowing more and more pre-taped colour transmissions to be received freely.\n\nPublic pressure on the issue of colour transmissions mounted, and in 1981 as the Israeli government sought to increase its popularity in light of the approaching general elections, IBA and IETV were allowed to start filming their own regular productions in colour. <<|needle|>>This process took more than two years and reached the last stretch on 16 February 1983 when the main daily newscast was broadcast in colour for the first time. <<|needle|>>According to Lapid's book, this first colour newscast was prepared secretly by some \"enthusiastic workers\" of IBA, in order to avoid industrial actions by the technicians' trade union, who demanded higher salaries for operating colour equipment. <<|needle|>>Lapid also mentions that the anti-mekhikon system cost IBA 180 million Israeli lira yearly (approximately 64 million Israeli new shekels in 2011 prices).In 1978 the Israeli government appointed a special committee to explore the establishment of a second channel that would not be under the IBA supervision and would be financed by advertising, however the idea of commercial television was rejected by some parties in the ruling coalition. <<|needle|>>In 7 October 1986, the Israeli minister of Communication ordered the beginning of \"experimental transmissions\" on a second channel, claiming that unless these transmissions had started, the frequencies would have been used by TV networks in neighbouring countries. <<|needle|>>These transmissions, which initially included 2–3 hours of video clips every evening, expanded gradually to include a full program lineup. <<|needle|>>At this stage the IBA was legally responsible for the channel, but in fact it saw it as an unexpected competition, tried to prevent its inauguration, and was reluctant to take responsibility for its broadcasts. <<|needle|>>In 1986 the Knesset started discussing the law forming the Second Israeli Broadcasting Authority, which was finally approved in 1990. <<|needle|>>This new body took responsibility for the second channel from this year onwards. <<|needle|>>From 1990 to 1993 the Second Broadcasting Authority reviewed bids from commercial companies to establish the regular commercial broadcasts of the second channel, which started on 4 November 1993. <<|needle|>>The second channel was officially handed to three concessionaires, starting the first commercial broadcasts in Israel. <<|needle|>>Pirated television broadcasts via cables became very popular in the major cities of Israel during the late 80s. <<|needle|>>These were usually local cable television stations broadcasting illegally from private houses to subscribers, mainly films released on video tapes. <<|needle|>>These local stations vanished with the introduction of regulated cable television in 1989.\n\nIsraeli television broadcasts mainly in Hebrew and English. <<|needle|>>While Hebrew is the common language of communication, numerous shows and series of different genres are bought from English-speaking countries. <<|needle|>>Unless the target audience is preschool children, subtitle translation is preferred over dubbing, not only for economic considerations. <<|needle|>>Subtitle translation is often bilingual, the secondary language being either Arabic or Russian. <<|needle|>>The state-owned Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) has an Arabic department which broadcasts news, talk shows, educational programs for children and Egyptian films on IBA's Channel 33. <<|needle|>>IBA's English department broadcasts a daily locally produced newscast. <<|needle|>>Commercial channels are obligated to broadcast a portion of their programs in Arabic and Russian, or alternatively translate programs into these languages. <<|needle|>>There is also a legal obligation on all channels to translate some of their newscasts into the Israeli Sign Language[7].\n\nIn 2002, an Israeli Russian-speaking commercial channel was launched, named Israel Plus. <<|needle|>>A similar Arabic-speaking channel started broadcasting in March 2012, after several attempts to establish it earlier failed[8] The first bid for the establishment of this channel was published in 1995, but canceled for formal legal problems. <<|needle|>>In January 2003, a new bid was published[9], but the winning company failed to fulfill its financial obligations[10]. <<|needle|>>A final modified bid was published on 14 April 2010[11][12], for which eight companies competed. <<|needle|>>The Halla TV Company was selected in September 2011.JMS Tuning has unveiled their latest project based on the 2013 Mercedes-Benz

in the industry we’re really just speaking about “graphs”. <<|needle|>>It’s like the crypto/cryptography/cryptocurrency conflation – something cryptography researchers have begrudgingly embraced if it means increased funding and visibility for their work.\n\nPerhaps it’s that adding the word “knowledge” to whatever you’re working on makes it sounds more definitive. <<|needle|>>Geospatial visualization behemoth Esri have co-opted the term with their new ArcGIS offering, “Knowledge.” Other terms are ripe for the picking: take the new decentralized finance company “The Graph” and blockchain “Ontology” – both translucent attempts to sound weighty, absolute.\n\nI just finished Jer Thorp’s “Living in Data” – a thoughtful, lyrical book that goes into great detail on the responsibilities and realities of transforming data into something meaningful.\n\nAlmost all of my visualization work has taken the form of exploratory tools. <<|needle|>>Even in the case where the result is a static image (like the PopSci piece), I build my own vehicles, to make it easy for me to range widely across a data set’s terrain. <<|needle|>>More often, I let others drive.\n\nThe Pudding article articulates it’s point so well simply by toggling between a “traditional” and plain version of the same text. <<|needle|>>The toggle is a simple steering wheel. <<|needle|>>Combined with animations, this direct, visual comparison goes a long way to highlighting the different approaches.\n\nThe article also delves into some of the techniques used to model the complexity of text. <<|needle|>>These include some “black box” proprietary algorithms where there’s limited public information of the approach and weightings of the algorithm.\n\nIt reminds me of “what3words” – touted as a potentially life-saving method of defining specific coordinates on a map with simple English words, it’s a flawed proprietary algorithm that could cause further confusion from the use of similar or pluralized words for locations in close proximity.\n\nTom MacWright didn’t hold back in a recent book review aside:\n\nBut seriously, there’s no validity to this idea of what3words. <<|needle|>>If you’re in the middle of the woods, and you have internet access, and you open the app and memorize the words and tell the ambulance them and spend 30 seconds explaining what what3words is, well, are you real, or a marketing story. <<|needle|>>Wait, no, even in that situation it’s way to easy to say a word wrong and send the ambulance to the wrong place.\n\nThat link, by the way, takes the use of a “hairball” – an overwhelming mass of graph nodes and links in a visualization – to great effect. <<|needle|>>It shows just how many points in an area could be confused.\n\nAny sufficiently hard problem results in a market for commercial solutions. <<|needle|>>And those commercial offerings will compete to solve the problem in opaque, proprietary ways to attempt to gain an advantage.\n\nParsing language is hard enough on a syntactic level but once semantics are introduced it can seem insurmountable. <<|needle|>>Take the sentence:\n\nMore people have been to Berlin than I have\n\nThis sentence seems to make perfect sense. <<|needle|>>It has the right mouthfeel, the correct form, the appropriate notion. <<|needle|>>But it falls apart with the faintest bit of scrutiny. <<|needle|>>“Of course more people have been to Berlin than me, there are so many more people than me!” Here’s another one:\n\nWhile I was surfing the internet went down\n\nThese are sometimes known as Escher sentences, reminiscent of the twisty, inconsistent drawings from the 20th century artist.\n\nGarden-path sentences are a similar construct – the reader is “tricked” into parsing the sentence incorrectly. <<|needle|>>One succinct example is “the old man the boat.” Your brain follows the parsing path it expects to when reading and there’s a moment of disorientation when everything suddenly seems nonsensical and non-grammatical. <<|needle|>>Is the old man IN the boat? ON the boat?\n\nSpeaking of Escher and mind-bending writing, Douglas Hofstadter’s influential “Gödel, Escher, Bach”, describes a curious device and names it a “quine” – as per Wikipedia:\n\nI stumbled upon this fantastic quine on Twitter, blending code golf, the visualization abomination technique “metaballs”, fogs of war into a remarkable tweet-sized snippet.\n\nBut it’s the unfurled version of the code that tipped it into inclusion this week – I love the snaking indented view with expository comments for the casual reader. <<|needle|>>It’s not like I understand the code any better without extreme close examination but it goes a long way to help me parse it.As graph technology reaches more mainstream interest there’s a blurring of semantic lines between concepts in the space.\n\nFor example, here’s an article about a project to track tens of thousands of objects in space. <<|needle|>>Out of 26,000 objects orbiting the Earth, only around 3,500 – that’s around 13% of it – is actually used for a purpose. <<|needle|>>It’s an illuminating project that enables some mind-blowing visualizations.Pan around the 3D globe here and you get a much greater understanding of just how severe this problem is. <<|needle|>>At points you can barely see the earth for the dots floating in mid-space.\n\nBut in describing the project, concepts like knowledge graphs, graph databases and visualization are smooshed together into a homogenous blob.\n\nA family tree is a simple graph database.\n\nI mean, sure, this isn’t wrong, per say, but a family tree is as much of a graph database as sketching a route to the nearest train station is a simple atlas of the world.\n\nEven experts in traditional semantic graphs get confused by fundamental ideas in graph visualization – in this seminar summary from Juan Sequeda feels around the domain trying to massage some Spark Notes, but misses the creative, ephemeral angle of why we visualize data at all.\n\nOver in the intelligence trap that is the Personal Knowledge Management space – where the pursuit of knowledge is put on hold while the vessel for the knowledge is polished and tweaked for optimal polishing and tweaking. <<|needle|>>The term “graph” and “knowledge graphs” are co-opted with grandiose soundbites like “second brain” to give some faux structure to what is, essentially, writing shit down.\n\nAs one of many who strives toward accessible communication in the graph technology space, it’s tempting to declare inconsistent language and definitions as outright incorrect. <<|needle|>>But there’s a path of least resistance when it comes to the adoption and acceptance of technical techniques. <<|needle|>>I’m a strong advocate for real-world applications over academic navel-gazing; if people are inspired by technology to create interesting projects what does it matter what they call the technology? If the space is accessible and adaptable, then it is more conducive to creativity.\n\nMany thanks for Asaf Sharif for the mention of source/target on his Social Network Analytics podcast, NETfrix.

leaves the EU by the end of October.\n\nMr Raab refused to rule out proroguing the Commons in the Autumn to prevent MPs from blocking No Deal.\n\nBut the stark threat, delivered at hustings last night, sparked fury with other Conservatives accusing him of acting like a 17th Century king and warning the move would be ‘illegal’.\n\nThe row erupted as Environment Secretary Michael Gove launched an attack on front runner Boris Johnson, who has also made clear Brexit must happen by the end of October at all costs.At Tory hustings last night, Dominic Raab (pictured at BBC studios last month) refused to rule out proroguing the Commons in the Autumn to prevent MPs from blocking No DealBoris Johnson has said the UK must leave the EU by October 31. <<|needle|>>But Michael Gove said he would be prepared to delay the UK’s departure by days or weeks if he thought a deal was within reach\n\nMr Gove said he would be prepared to delay the UK’s departure by days or weeks if he thought a deal was within reach.\n\nRamping up his campaign, Mr Gove wrote in the Mail: ‘If we make the progress I know we can and we are on the cusp of a better deal which works for us, would it really be in the best interests of our country to opt for a No Deal exit when just a little more time and effort could make all the difference?\n\n‘Also, saying that we would leave come what may when there is still progress to be made, runs the risk of Parliament forcing us into a general election before Brexit is secured. <<|needle|>>That would hand Downing Street to a Jeremy Corbyn government propped up by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP.\n\n‘That would mean we lost Brexit altogether, risked the future of our Union, and handed the levers of power to a Marxist.’\n\nThe idea would mean using the PM’s executive powers to bring the Commons session to a close in the run-up to Brexit, so there is no opportunity for MPs to take control of the process.\n\nMr Stewart, another leadership contender, said: ‘All this talk about no-deal Brexit is a recipe for delay. <<|needle|>>It can’t be done.\n\n‘And the the reason why Dom Raab is saying he is going to prorogue Parliament, in other words try to shut the doors on Parliament, is because the only way that they could try to get it through is by doing that.\n\n‘That would be illegal, if they did it for the express purpose of getting it through.\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd referred to Charles I’s efforts to bypass Parliament – which ended with his execution in the 17th Century.‘I think it’s outrageous to consider proroguing Parliament. <<|needle|>>We are not Stuart kings,’ she said.\n\nFormer Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom told a hustings event on Tuesday night that she had taken advice from the Commons clerks and been told that proroguing to avoid Brexit being blocked was not possible.\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Tory hustings that Parliament would block a no-deal Brexit so the Tories needed a leader who could negotiate a better agreement.\n\nLabour reacted with anger at remarks by Mr Hancock at the Tory hustings on Mr Corbyn.\n\nAccording to a supporter of Mr Hancock, the Cabinet minister told colleagues at the gathering: ‘The Conservative Party has to get this right. <<|needle|>>If we don’t, we could end up with the first anti-Semitic leader of a Western nation since the Second World War.’\n\nAnd a Labour source said: ‘This baseless political attack rings hollow from a minister in a party that has supported governments that actively promote anti-Semitic policies in Hungary and Poland and has spent the week wooing Trump – the man who refused to condemn neo-fascists in Charlottesville who chanted ‘Jews will not replace us’.\n\n‘Numerous candidates in the

may be the most controversial issue, as it entails lifestyles that require less energy use. <<|needle|>>The necessary reduction in energy demand is of great magnitude. <<|needle|>>A scenario that is compatible[2] with limiting global temperature rise below 1.5 ºC requires a decrease in total energy demand to 32 percent below 2010 levels by 2050. <<|needle|>>However, the reduction should be twice as large in rich countries, where energy use is higher, in order to account for their higher historical use and to prioritise equitable access to resources for those who have less.\n\nReduction in demand must be planned democratically, with clear priorities, categories, and pathways for advancement, based on socio-environmental justice and good living. <<|needle|>>This is incompatible with a ‘free market’ in energy, which lacks the capacity for self-regulation in order to reduce the volume of energy resources being commercialised.\n\nInstead this will require socially building means and systems for satisfying genuine material and energetic needs, eliminating superfluous consumption. <<|needle|>>Above all, it urgently requires setting a common goal for reducing energy use, and transforming the notion that increasing energy use is good for the general population.\n\nThe scenarios described below demonstrate the debate on how we could meet increasing energy demands worldwide as the global population grows and many societies adopt more energy-intensive technologies and lifestyles.\n\nAccording to BP (British Petroleum, 2018), 13.51 billion tons of oil equivalent (TOE) were consumed in 2017 to meet all global energy needs, which is equivalent to an average annual power of approximately 17.9 terawatts (TW). <<|needle|>>This means that the worldwide per capita consumption is 1.92 TOE per person per year. <<|needle|>> Following BP’s scenario, based on the continuity of the current (increasing) trend in energy consumption, would mean consumption of 17.86 million TOE in 2040, equivalent to an average annual power of 23.71 TW. <<|needle|>>This increase in energy demand, met through any existing technology, would put the survival of a large portion of humanity, and other species on the planet, at risk.<image>We must assess the extent of the changes needed. <<|needle|>>An alternative scenario, proposed by Ecofys, suggests instead a substantial reduction in demand,[3] meaning that energy consumption in 2040 would be approximately 6.45 billion TOE, equivalent to an average annual demand of 8.56 TW: half of that registered in 2017.The table and graph give us an idea of the magnitude of the challenge in terms of culture and reduction of consumption. <<|needle|>>It should be noted that ‘per capita data’ obscures inequalities in distribution among the population. <<|needle|>>In the existing system, it is likely that the reduction in demand will differ according to income level and access to energy. <<|needle|>>This reduction must therefore be accompanied by redistribution policies and guaranteed access to basic energy for the entire population.\n\nTherefore, it is not only a matter of planning a decrease in energy use, but of changing the socio-economic system, which should operate with an undeniably lower amount of available energy.\n\nChanges to the demand side of energy are key to a peoples’ energy transition. <<|needle|>>An effective reduction in energy use is the first option. <<|needle|>>Energy efficiency measures associated with the various processes of energy transformation are not enough. <<|needle|>>Undoubtedly, the main path is to change consumption and production patterns worldwide, re-creating new ways of achieving a good life with fewer materials and less energy.Despite how rough the year 2021 was to

architecture firm HOK turned to nature for design inspiration, Biomimicry 3.8’s team of world-class architects and engineers went to work.\n\nThis Missoula-based company combines for-profit consulting with not-for-profit advocacy to advance the field of biomimicry; solving human problems by replicating the adaptive mechanisms found in nature. <<|needle|>>The “3.8” in the company’s name refers to the 3.8 billion years life is believed to have existed on Earth, forming myriad solutions at evolution’s design table.\n\n“Companies are trying to mimic what nature does because it’s efficient, saves them energy, it’s good for PR, and because it’s cheaper,” says Robyn Klein, a biologist and research analyst for 3.8.\n\nExamples of biomimicry abound, and were present in industry before the term itself. <<|needle|>>Klein points out that one of the earliest industrial applications of biomimicry is Velcro, which was invented by a Swiss engineer who noticed the way plant burrs stuck to his dog.A more modern example is found in an office complex in tropical Zimbabwe. <<|needle|>>The building’s self-cooling<image>system is inspired by termites that design their mounds to maintain a constant temperature, even as outside air temps swing from hot desert days to cold nights. <<|needle|>>The result is a building that uses 90 percent less energy than those of similar size, according to 3.8’s website.\n\nWhen a new client comes to Biomimicry 3.8 – and past business includes Coca-Cola, Boeing, Dupont, Nike and Shell, to name a few – the first step is to establish a challenge for a researcher like Klein to focus on.\n\nWith HOK, the challenge was to look at a biome, or particular ecosystem type, for lessons that could be applied to architecture. <<|needle|>>The Biomimicry 3.8 team chose to study temperate broadleaf forests, found all over the world.\n\nStudying the designs and systems a forest uses to manage itself comes naturally to biologists; translating that knowledge for engineers and architects isn’t so easy.\n\n“Part of the difficulty is that the language of biology is all around the organism and how the organism functions in its environment … The language of business doesn’t talk like that at all,” says Jakki Mohr, a University of Montana Regents professor of marketing who has researched biomimicry’s success in business culture.\n\n“We have to walk over to the middle of that bridge,” Klein says. <<|needle|>>“We’re handing them our translation of science so that they don’t have to do it.”\n\nKlein gets a little breathless when she describes biomimicry’s possibilities, and a question such as what companies she most admires for sustainability (Patagonia) can end in a discussion of how to rework our agricultural system.\n\nFor the last seven years, Klein has helped 3.8 use biomimicry to solve problems, like one of HOK’s challenges – how building designers deal with rainwater.\n\n“We take that challenge and we biologize it. <<|needle|>>For example, with water we looked at the temperate broadleaf forest and we [examined] how water works in that forest,” Klein says, adding that this led them to beaver dams. <<|needle|>>“But they’re leaky dams, they don’t hold everything back. <<|needle|>>Nature’s been around 3.8 billion years, and figured out that a leaky dam is best.”Leaky dams slow water flow without building up pressure. <<|needle|>>The biologists were not suggesting that the architects put dams on the roofs of their buildings, but instead recommending the “design principle” of a series of upstream barriers to slow water’s flow.\n\nIn this case, according to Klein, the architects and biologists discussed how to site buildings in order of height, so that rainwater could run from the tallest, down. <<|needle|>>If the concept worked, a system could be put in place to temper water to a trickle by the time it reached street level, mimicking a series of leaky beaver dams.\n\nHOK put this concept into practice in 2012 when designing a new building in Maryland for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. <<|needle|>>The slanted roof moves rainwater along its length, slowing its flow with a series of barriers.\n\nIn the quest for a more sustainable world, biomimicry gets a lot of hype for its widespread potential. <<|needle|>>In January 2014, the Fermanian Business and Economic Institute reported that by 2030, bio-inspired developments could account for $425 billion of the U.S. <<|needle|>>gross domestic product. <<|needle|>>And $65 billion could be saved through the pollution mitigation found in most biomimetic technologies.\n\nMohr called the assessment a best-case scenario of the field’s future, but one that “really lays the landscape for what the ecosystem of biomimicry could look like if it really does gain traction.”\n\nWhen Klein was asked if she sees biomimicry as the solution to industry’s environmental problems, she answers with a question of her own: “What would nature do?”\n\n“Nature doesn’t reach just one solution,” she says. <<|needle|>>“We need lots of solutions. <<|needle|>>We need to collaborate.” And then she is off, breathlessly describing the ecosystem role played by the apple tree.\n\nAndrew Graham is pursuing a master’s degree in Environmental Science Journalism from the University of Montana. <<|needle|>>He enjoys the campus full of topnotch researchers, not to mention its backyard full of mountains.Snow leopards are incredibly beautiful animals that have evolved to live in one of the harshest climates in the world. <<|needle|>>These apex predators have captured the hearts of people all across the globe with their beautiful fur, fluffy feet, and cute faces. <<|needle|>>While they may look cute and cuddly, these predators are capable of amazing feats of strength when hunting and defending their territory. <<|needle|>>In this article, we will go over 15 interesting facts about snow leopards, from what they eat to how they live.\n\n1. <<|needle|>>What is the snow leopard’s closest relative?\n\nSnow leopards get their names from their spots and rosettes that are similar in appearance to African leopards. <<|needle|>>However, these cats are actually more closely related to tigers. <<|needle|>>Tigers and snow leopards are thought to have evolved from the same ancestor roughly 2 million years ago. <<|needle|>>Tigers ended up in lower elevations and tropical climates and snow leopards became the kings of the mountains.\n\n2. <<|needle|>>How big are snow leopards?\n\nWhile they give the illusion of being large, most of their size is fur. <<|needle|>>These animals actually weigh less than many house dogs, with young adults and small females weighing around 60lbs and males maxing out at around 120lbs. <<|needle|>>They are an average of about 2 feet tall, and 4-5 feet long, not including their 3-foot tails. <<|needle|>>This makes them the smallest big cats in the world.Snow leopards are native to alpine and subalpine areas in the mountains of Central Asia. <<|needle|>>Most notably the Himalayan Mountains. <<|needle|>>They are often referred to as the Ghosts of the Mountains due to their impressive ability to disappear among their surroundings with their camouflaged coats.\n\nWhile you may not think of snow leopards as migrators, they do travel to different elevations in the warm and cold seasons. <<|needle|>>Once the weather warms up, the snow leopards move up the mountain to elevations around 10,000-20,000 feet. <<|needle|>>When it turns cold again, they make their way down the mountains to around 4,000 feet.\n\n5. <<|needle|>>When are snow leopards most active?\n\nSnow leopards are naturally crepuscular, which means they are most active at dawn and dusk. <<|needle|>>However, they will adapt to the availability of prey and the presence of humans. <<|needle|>>When humans are in the area, snow leopards will often begin hunting at night.\n\n6. <<|needle|>>How do snow leopards hunt?\n\nSnow leopards prefer to hunt their prey from above and chase them downhill. <<|needle|>>They can leap over 50 feet forward and 20 feet high, leaving most prey animals unable to escape.\n\n7. <<|needle|>>What do snow leopards hunt?\n\nSnow leopards prefer to hunt large herbivores like ibex, mountain goats, and mountain sheep. <<|needle|>>Animals that can often be 2-3 times their size! However, when prey is scarce, they will also go after smaller animals like rabbits, voles, and birds.When hunting is good and snow leopards are able to bring down large prey, they will usually go 1-2 weeks between hunting forays. <<|needle|>>They will store their prey in the snow and return to it to feed until the carcass is gone. <<|needle|>>Then they will go out hunting again.\n\nYou may also

to this is mothers and babies who can stay together for up to 22 months.\n\n10. <<|needle|>>How many babies do snow leopards have?\n\nFemale snow leopards reach maturity at around 3 years old and that is usually when they have their first litter. <<|needle|>>Each litter consists of an average of 2 babies but can be as many as 5. <<|needle|>>Babies stay with their mother until they are around 2 years old and then they venture off on their own to find new territories.\n\n11. <<|needle|>>How long do snow leopards live?\n\nOn average, snow leopards live 10-15 years. <<|needle|>>They don’t have any natural predators as adults, but they do often fall prey to poaching and are suffering from habitat loss.\n\n12. <<|needle|>>How many snow leopards are there in the wild?\n\nIt’s unknown how many snow leopards there are in the wild, as about 70% of their habitat remains unexplored. <<|needle|>>Scientists are able to estimate based on their known density in explored areas and believe their numbers to be somewhere around 4500-8000.\n\n13. <<|needle|>>How many snow leopards are there in captivity?\n\nThere are close to 600 snow leopards in zoos across the world. <<|needle|>>This captive population is managed through the species survival program which is working to make sure the snow leopard is around to stay. <<|needle|>>The organization helps zoos to find the best potential mates for animals in their care to keep the gene pool as diverse as possible.Snow leopards are considered vulnerable by the IUCN or International Union for Conservation of Nature. <<|needle|>>This Switzerland-based organization is responsible for compiling data on habitats across the world and the animals that live in them. <<|needle|>>They then give each animal a designation which are in order of gravity, extinct, extinct in the wild, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable,  near threatened, and least concerned. <<|needle|>>Scientists then use these classifications to prioritize resources and protect at-risk species.\n\n15. <<|needle|>>What are the biggest threats to snow leopards?\n\nThe two most significant threats to snow leopards are climate change and habitat loss. <<|needle|>>While these majestic animals make their homes in mountain ranges, each individual needs a relatively large territory to live and hunt. <<|needle|>>As humans expand, so do farms and towns. <<|needle|>>Lots of human activity scares away prey and causes snow leopards to go after farm animals like yaks, sheep, and goats. <<|needle|>>Farmers will then kill them to protect their livestock.\n\nClimate change is also threatening their habitat. <<|needle|>>As the snow and ice in their region melt their coats are no longer able to help them blend into their surroundings, making hunting and evading humans harder.\n\nPoaching is also a significant threat to snow leopard populations, with several hundred killed each year for illegal trade. <<|needle|>>Their bones are used in traditional Asian medicine and their pelts are sold for high dollars on the black market.1. <<|needle|>>The 2014 budget crisis and December agreement\n\nLess than three months after winning the election in September 2014, Löfven was met by his first government crisis.\n\nAfter the Social Democrat-Green Party minority government’s proposed budget was rejected on December 3rd 2014 in favour of the right-wing opposition’s budget, Löfven said he would call a snap election to take place the following March to enable voters to “make a choice in the face of this new political landscape”, which for constitutional reasons couldn’t be formally called until December 29th 2014.\n\nThe crisis was caused by the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, who held a kingmaker position, choosing to vote in favour of the opposition’s budget. <<|needle|>>But two days before the snap election was due to be called, Löfven announced that the crisis had been averted, after talks between Löfven and the country’s four centre-right parties – known then as the Alliance.\n\nThe new deal was called the “December Agreement” (decemberöverenskommelsen in Swedish, or simply DÖ) and its goal was to ensure that a minority government could govern Sweden. <<|needle|>>“With this agreement, the government will not be making any decision about an extra election, it is simply not of immediate interest,” said Löfven at the time.\n\nThe deal meant that the opposition would not vote for its own alternative budget in future votes if this threatened the elected government’s budget from getting passed. <<|needle|>>It was originally meant to end in 2022, but ended up being scrapped less than a year later in October 2015 by the Christian Democrats.\n\nIt was the first, but not the last time that Löfven had to navigate a government crisis during his time at the helm.Stefan Löfven’s press conference in 2014 after the Sweden Democrats said they would topple the government. <<|needle|>>Photo: Pontus Lundahl/TT\n\nAutumn of 2015 offered another challenge for Löfven, which has arguably defined Swedish politics ever since.\n\nIn 2015, Sweden took in an unprecedented 163,000 asylum seekers – a shock for the country which was unprepared for so many – authorities had originally predicted as late as June 2015 that the number of asylum seekers applying would be lower than in 2014.\n\nWhen questioned in 2016 by parliament on how the crisis was handled, Löfven described it as “a great challenge for Swedish society” adding that it was hard to judge the severity of the situation at the time. <<|needle|>>The government was criticised for waiting until November 2015 to introduce border controls, despite the fact that over 70 percent of refugees arriving to Sweden in 2015 arrived in September.\n\nLöfven defended this decision, explaining that the police and the Migration Agency did not believe that border control requirements had been met before this point. <<|needle|>>He explained that EU rules on border controls had to be followed, saying that it would be difficult to explain to the EU why the government had introduced border controls before the police deemed it necessary.\n\nSweden also tightened asylum rules, including making temporary rather than permanent residence permits the norm, a move described at the time as temporary, but which later made it into Sweden’s Migration Act as the Social Democrats toughened its stance on immigration.\n\nAsylum applications have dropped in recent years to below 22,000 in the year before the pandemic (in 2020 the number was below 13,000). <<|needle|>>Sweden’s stricter migration laws have affected all categories of immigrants, including parents, doctoral students and work permit holders.3. <<|needle|>>The long post-election negotiations in 2018\n\nSweden’s elections in September 2018 were too close to call, with neither one party nor one of the coalitions (centre-left: Social Democrats, Green Party, Left Party; centre-right: Moderate Party, Liberal Party, Centre Party, Christian Democrats) winning the 175 seats needed to form a majority government. <<|needle|>>Support rose for the far-right Sweden Democrats, albeit not as significantly as some polls had suggested it might.\n\nThis marked the beginning of a long, drawn-out negotiation period, with discussions continuing for 116 days until Löfven’s Social Democrat-Green coalition government – also known as the red-green coalition – was finally reelected in January 2019. <<|needle|>>With the coalition only holding 33 percent of seats in parliament, it’s been one of the weakest governments in Swedish history, reliant on support from other parties.\n\nThis support was a result of an agreement signed in January 2019, commonly referred to as the januariavtal or January Agreement. <<|needle|>>It provided backing from the Centre Party and the Liberals to the red-green coalition. <<|needle|>>In return, the government was bound by policy points set out in the January Agreement.\n\nThis agreement lasted until 2021, when the Left Party called a vote of no-confidence against Löfven in protest towards plans to introduce unregulated rent rates in newly built rental apartments (keep reading for more on that).<image>The outbreak of Covid-19 at the start of 2020 provided yet another challenge for Löfven, with widespread – and ongoing – discussions about Sweden’s unusual pandemic response.\n\nUnlike other countries, Sweden’s politicians were not particularly involved in the early pandemic response, instead handing over authority to the Public Health Agency. <<|needle|>>This is protected by Swedish law, where ministerial rule of individual agencies and authorities is prohibited. <<|needle|>>Ministers are not allowed to interfere in day-to-day operations of government agencies, and must instead amend relevant laws if they wish to change the way agencies work.\n\nAdditionally, Sweden’s pandemic response, unlike in other countries, was not built on widespread testing, lockdowns or usage of face masks, choosing instead to rely on people’s personal responsibility to keep distance from each other and avoid meeting too many people. <<|needle|>>It later stepped up testing efforts and the government introduced a series of laws, including restricting opening hours for restaurants.\n\nThis has been widely discussed both within and outside Sweden, with the independent Coronavirus Commission due to release a report on this aspect of the pandemic response in February 2022. <<|needle|>>The commission’s report from October 2021 painted a damning portrait of other parts of the response, describing aspects as a “complete failure”. <<|needle|>>Löfven described this choice of words as “a bit of a stretch”.As previously mentioned briefly, Löfven lost a vote of no-confidence called by the Left Party in summer 2021, after a proposal to introduce unregulated rents in newly built properties. <<|needle|>>He was the first prime minister in modern Swedish history to lose such a vote.\n\nLöfven remained prime minister during this time as part of a caretaker government, eventually being re-elected just weeks later after 173 MPs voted against him – two shy of the 175 MP limit required for him to not be re-elected.\n\nAfter the re-election, Löfven continued as Sweden’s prime minister with an almost identical cabinet, despite the fact that the January Agreement – and therefore his support – was technically no longer in effect. <<|needle|>>In practice, parties have continued to follow this agreement, with the red-green coalition now tacitly supported by the Centre Party and the Left Party.\n\nJust over a month later, on August 22nd 2021, Löfven announced his plans to resign as party leader and as prime minister at the party congress in November, after seven years as prime minister and ten as leader of the Social Democrats.\n\nHis expected successor in both roles is current Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson, who has been approved by the Social Democrats to take over as their leader. <<|needle|>>To become prime minister, she will have to approved by parliament. <<|needle|>>If successful, she will become Sweden’s first female prime minister.These gifts from Men’s Recovery alumni represent Jerry’s knack for getting to the heart of issues: One of the men once called Jerry “the stick God uses to poke us,” and it stuck. <<|needle|>>It’s actually an honor, because as the men and Jerry both know, dealing with the unhealed wounds of the heart is where real recovery is found.“They know that I love them and care enough about them to take them to the hard places and be in the journey with them.”\n\nAfter 23 years helping men overcome addiction, homelessness and a host of related issues, Jerry is getting ready to retire – but, God willing, Jerry’s fingerprints will remain on what has become one of the best recovery programs in the country.\n\nThat’s because most recovery programs “don’t approach it from the right aspect of what a guy really needs. <<|needle|>>They stick with superficial stuff. <<|needle|>>They don’t go to the heart, they don’t get underneath. <<|needle|>>You’ve got to go there in order to help a guy. <<|needle|>>Most people, when they go to recovery, they never really deal with a broken heart.”\n\nJerry arrived at UGM as chaplain in 1997, when there was still only a handful of staff, so his responsibilities at the Men’s Shelter were widely varied. <<|needle|>>Shortly after arriving, he was tapped to set up the first Vocational Education facility at the shelter. <<|needle|>>Overseeing that area, Jerry began to see how crucial the educational experience is to the recovery process, and he was part of the team that laid the foundation for the recovery program as it is today.\n\nWith the implementation of the Grace Process at UGM in the early 2000s, Jerry formally took the lead of the men's recovery program. <<|needle|>>He also met Kari, UGM’s Grace specialist, who became his wife and a wonderfully suited “other half.” Their personalities couldn't be much more different, with Kari's empathetic people skills and Jerry's pragmatic directness. <<|needle|>>But Jerry has learned what he knows about the softer side of recovery from Kari.\n“Kari has taught me so much ... <<|needle|>>She's really helped me relationally, to develop those relational skills and develop greater sensitivity and compassion and empathy for people. <<|needle|>>How to get in touch with their hurt and pain and how to guide them through all that.”Over the years, Jerry and his team have incorporated other life-changing elements of the program, such as the Genesis Process, Authentic Manhood, and the Life Languages profile that helps participants understand and relate to one another and themselves.\n\nAnd Jerry’s worked hard to establish the consistency UGM residents need in order to rebuild the ability to trust, which has been damaged in each of their lives in one way or another. <<|needle|>>That means showing up, being the same person on the clock or off, confessing mistakes, and graciously saying hard things that need to be said. <<|needle|>>That’s how Jerry has earned the trust of the residents, most of whom have never had a healthy father figure in their lives.\n\nHe gets it. <<|needle|>>He’s been there, in fact. <<|needle|>>And like a good father, he cares enough to lead them through a little pain for the sake of freedom in Christ − to help them stop running away and face their problems with the power God gives to overcome them.\n\nThough he didn’t know it, Jerry was in training for UGM the entire first half of his career. <<|needle|>>Enlisting in the Air Force took him all across the U.S., including Guam. <<|needle|>>He worked in administration, revealing a God-given gift for managing people and projects. <<|needle|>>He enjoyed a lot of professional success because of those hard-wired administrative skills.“I’ve never had to look for it. <<|needle|>>That was one of the weird things that I discerned.... I got asked to do things.”\nMeanwhile, he was gaining experience that would be invaluable in his time at UGM.\n\nJerry worked in support of military families. <<|needle|>>He learned how various programs, systems and technologies were designed. <<|needle|>>He worked with airmen who were struggling with drug and alcohol addictions, as well as other personal issues. <<|needle|>>Over and over, he found people coming to him for help. <<|needle|>>“God orchestrated that I would be able to be in work environments that would hone and refine those skills.”\n\nBut it wasn’t his career that gave Jerry his best preparation to work with people in recovery; it was the dark spiritual journey that came when he went through a divorce and became a single dad with four young children. <<|needle|>>That began the seven hardest, most painful years of his life.\n\n“God really pressed in on me, and really sifted me and purged me and did a lot of work in me. <<|needle|>>That went on for quite a few years... <<|needle|>>That’s where my journey of recovery really started.”\n\nJerry clung to God’s faithfulness and good plans for his life. <<|needle|>>He began to face deeply ingrained issues that arose from his difficult childhood. <<|needle|>>And he found out God was the only person he could really trust – he certainly couldn’t trust his own way.\n\n“I had to do a lot of work. <<|needle|>>But I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”\n\nGetting ready to retire from the Air Force after 24 years, Jerry planned to pursue further education for a job in business management. <<|needle|>>But though it was a logical next step, he wasn’t excited about it.\n\n“In my heart I wasn’t satisfied with that. <<|needle|>>So I just prayed all the time: ‘God, I don’t care what it is, I just want to be in the center of your will. <<|needle|>>That’s all I care about.’ And there were many days when I wept and sobbed over that because money didn’t matter to me, or positions. <<|needle|>>I don't care about any of that stuff. <<|needle|>>Not important to me. <<|needle|>>I just wanted to be where God wanted me to be.”That’s when a church friend mentioned the opening at the Union Gospel Mission. <<|needle|>>Jerry met with Men’s Shelter director Randy Altmeyer, spent time in the shelter with residents, and prayed.\n\nThe opportunity struck a chord in Jerry’s heart. <<|needle|>>Fifteen years earlier, shortly after a colleague had led him to faith in Jesus, Jerry was praying and reading the Bible when he heard the Holy Spirit say, “One day, you’re going to have a ministry with men.”\n\nAt the time, Jerry was surprised: “I had never had any experience like that. <<|needle|>>Where is this coming from?” Jerry knew he didn’t have the relational skills or wisdom to do ministry. <<|needle|>>But he wanted God’s will. <<|needle|>>He told the Lord, “If that’s true, then do whatever you have to do in my life.” Several times during his military career, Jerry heard the Spirit’s same message in his heart and gave the same answer. <<|needle|>>God was working on his heart, even − perhaps especially − through those darkest years.\n\nFinally, UGM became Jerry’s chance to put his training into practice and follow that call.\n\nKnow God and others\n\nIt’s been a fruitful 23 years of sharing hope and healing with broken men. <<|needle|>>When counselor Mike Scholz takes the director's reins from Jerry upon his retirement this summer, Jerry knows Mike will continue the real crux of the recovery program: Healing the heart.\n\nAs he leaves, Jerry wants to remind the UGM community to focus on knowing the depth of God’s love, for UGM staff and partners as well as the people we serve. <<|needle|>>He quotes Jeremiah 9:23-24:\n\n“Let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the Lord, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,” declares the Lord.\n\nJerry points out that we all long to be truly known; God himself wants to be known rightly. <<|needle|>>And so do the people who come to UGM for help.\n\nKnowing them in their restored selves is also Jerry’s greatest career satisfaction.\n\n“The most satisfying thing is watching guys experience freedom. <<|needle|>>They’re free from their addictions, they’re secure in who they are, they’ve received healing.”\n\nThere's nothing like experience to help you truly understand an issue. <<|needle|>>UGM Executive Director Phil Altmeyer's 30-plus years in homeless ministry have given him powerful insights to share in his free e-book, Lessons from a Homeless Shelter.The Bullitt Group and Land Rover have teamed up to produce an exciting new smart phone designed for the outdoors and adventurers. <<|needle|>>Seamus Allardice put it through its paces.<image>Set up for 24 hours of adventures and phone testing in the Trans Baviaans ultra-endurance MTB race.\n\nWho the Explore is for…\n\nThe Explore Outdoor Phone was developed by UK based tech firm Bullitt – makers of the Caterpillar rugged phones – in conjunction with Land Rover to fulfil the need for a life-proof smart phone which can cope with the dual needs of urban and adventure use. <<|needle|>>While the Cat phones are designed with construction and engineering uses in mind, the Land Rover Explore phone is intended for people who want all the features of the latest smart phone but with the added bonus of adventure compatible function.\n\nThe primary advantages the Explore holds over its standard smart phone rivals is its massive 4 000mAh battery and solid shell which helps provide IP68* dust and water resistance. <<|needle|>>The solid shell also means the phone can cope with being dropped from 1.8 meters and will still maintain its IP68 rating. <<|needle|>>It was also designed to handle extremes of temperature, from -30°C to 65°C and ships with an external battery pack which clips magnetically to the back of the phone. <<|needle|>>The external battery pack, or Adventure Pack as it has been named, provides an additional 3 600mAH of battery life and also includes a Ceramic Patch GPS antenna to improve the accuracy of the phone’s GPS tracking.In low light the screen automatically adjusts to a sepia like tone which does not disrupt your night vision when looking away from the screen.\n\nSpecification wise it features 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card. <<|needle|>>It weighs in at a fairly hefty 232g, is 152 x 75.3 x 14mm in size, has a 5 inch (1920 x 1080px) screen and runs on the Android Nougat operating system. <<|needle|>>On the camera front it boasts an 18MP main camera and an 8MP selfie one too.\n\nIt comes pre-loaded with a limited number of applications – mostly with outdoor uses – the primary of these are the Land Rover Explore Hub, the Dashboard and ViewRanger. <<|needle|>>The Explore Hub provides Land Rover content curated. <<|needle|>>The Dashboard, provides relevant data from the Explore’s sensors like the compass, altitude GPS and weather forecasts from World Weather Online. <<|needle|>>The data which is displayed on the Dashboard can be personalised for a variety of activities on the device. <<|needle|>>ViewRanger is arguably the best of the phone’s pre-loaded apps and is effectively Google Maps on steroids, complete with topographical data and access to user generated routes for hikes, trail runs and rides.The IP68 rating means the Explore is rated as protected from contact with harmful dust and from immersion in water with a depth of 1 meter for 30 minutes.\n\nAll of these features are great but how does the Explore cope in the real world? I took the phone on a number of rides, took photos and tracked on Strava, and then used it while covering the Trans Baviaans Repeat on social media (view the Insta story here) – while riding. <<|needle|>>What I really liked was the peace of mind it provides, unlike my usual smart phone, I didn’t have to fiddle with a waterproof bag or worry about dropping it while riding and filming. <<|needle|>>The extended battery life is also a massive plus, in real world conditions it survived 16 hours of taking photos and videos, plus uploading them to WhatsApp and Instagram Stories before I had to ditch the Adventure Pack and plug an external powerbank into it. <<|needle|>>My Sony Xperia X Compact can usually do about 3-4 hours before I need to power it up again. <<|needle|>>But that impact resistance and battery life comes with a weight penalty, at 232g it is 58g heavier than the iPhone X – which though slightly smaller boasts a bigger screen.\n\nWith its Android operating system I found it very easy to use and almost instantly personalisable, as I could just download my usual apps after logging in to my Google account. <<|needle|>>I ran Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Strava, a voice recorder for podcating and a slim video editor and was impressed at the Explore’s processing capacity. <<|needle|>>Perhaps because of its ability to run at high temperatures it does not slow down when running multiple RAM sucking apps at once. <<|needle|>>My only bug-bear with the operating system was the pre-loaded keyboard which did not automatically include full stops with a double space or provide capital letters at the start of sentences – but that’s easily remedied with a new keyboard app.\n\nThe Details… The battery pack attaches magnetically to the back of the phone. <<|needle|>>It features clear Land Rover branding for the brand conscious. <<|needle|>>And it charges via high speed fast USB-C port.* The first number in the IP rating refers to resistance to solids (6 = Protection from contact with harmful dust) while the second refers to protection from liquids (8 = Protected from immersion in water with a depth of more than 1 meter; manufacturer must specify exact depth, which in this case is 1 meter for 30 minutes).Here’s a better look at the Land Rover Explore Phone.The Explore ships with the adventure battery pack and a case which houses the phone when the adventure pack is connected. <<|needle|>>All other accessories, including the standard cover and bike mount are sold separately.Packed and ready for adventure.<image>DarkHotel is a cyber espionage campaign targeting well-known corporate executives and political leaders in Malaysia, Japan, India, and other countries.What is fascinating about this particular syndicate is their advanced skill set, and ability to leverage high-level penetration techniques to accomplish their goal (ex. <<|needle|>>kernel mode key logger, reverse engineering certs, and 0-day exploits).\nIn addition, after successful exfiltration of the targeted data, they are able to remove any trace of their existence from the network, making it much harder for security professionals to put the pieces of the puzzle back together.\nThis blog is a deep dive into mining domains associated with the DarkHotel attackers, and an attempt to extract any patterns in their behavior. <<|needle|>>Some of the techniques we employed were mining WHOIS records, GeoIP data, ASN/Organization data, and performing natural language text processing on the actual DarkHotel domains themselves.\nDarkHotel attacks usually begin by compromising a hotel’s Wi-Fi network and targeting the victim by tricking them into downloading/installing a backdoor. <<|needle|>>For example, they may send a phishing email targeting an executive, saying their current version of Adobe Flash or anti-virus software needs to be upgraded.\nThinking about this from an attacker perspective, we would need to somehow advertise the link to click on to the victim. <<|needle|>>How would we go about doing this? Well, in general, people always like to get stuff for free, so we may include the word “free” or “cheap” in the domain. <<|needle|>>Additionally, less-tech savvy business execs or politicians are not aware of these means of infection, and are more likely to click on a link saying they need to update their software, improve security, or possibly read some sort of business or news site. <<|needle|>>Let’s take a look at some examples:\nTypically, malicious domains fall into the pattern of using common “abuse” words, which is why we decided to use natural language text processing techniques for this experiment. <<|needle|>>One of the techniques we used to analyze these domains was to extract all the words found in the English dictionary and try to find any commonalities. <<|needle|>>We also leveraged a natural language processing technique from the Python NLTK library called stemming to help increase accuracy when extracting the most important words from a text.\nStemming is a normalization technique which extracts the root of the word, and subjects it to a series of transformations such as stripping out common prefixes or suffixes. <<|needle|>>To give an example, the word “countries” would become “countri” after stemming. <<|needle|>>One of the reasons we chose stemming was to get the most accurate evaluation of a domain, and to lower the false negative rate.\nFor example, when we compared the DarkHotel domains against domain examples found in the Mandiant APT 1 report, there were domains such as applesoftupdate[.]com and webserviceupdate[.]com. <<|needle|>>Without stemming, if we had just taken the dictionary word “update”, we would have missed domains like firefoxupdata[.]com. <<|needle|>>Here are some of the results after extracting the top dictionary words out of the DarkHotel domains list:\nauto: 75 occurrences\nupdat: 32\nserv: 18\nfree: 25\nonline: 6\nnews: 10\n(Also worth mentioning: 10 occurrences of “autoupdate”)\nWhat is interesting to note is that both APT and DarkHotel domains share common “themes” and obfuscation techniques. <<|needle|>>Some of these themes can be found in the report under the category “naming themes” (p. <<|needle|>>48). <<|needle|>>Both sets of domains seem to share common themes of containing words related to “news” and “technology”. <<|needle|>>For example, some news related domains found among DarkHotel domains are:\ndailynews[.]000page[.]com\ninnewsmessenger[.]com\nnewsagencypool[.]com\nHere are some of the domains associated with news found in Mandiant’s report:\nmyyahoonews[.]com\nnewsesport[.]com\nnewsonet[.]net\nnewsonlinesite[.]com\nThis make sense, as it is more likely that business executives would be interested in clicking on news links to read while browsing online in their room. <<|needle|>>DarkHotel domains also use methods of attaching themselves to well-known technology/software related companies to make them seem more legitimate to the victim. <<|needle|>>Here are some examples found in both sets trying to attach themselves with established tech companies:\n\nAPT 1 domains:\nmicrosoft-update-info[.]com\nfirefoxupdata[.]com\ngmailboxes[.]com\nSimilarly, spoofing of security products/domains occurs in both sets: in the APT 1 report: symanteconline[.]net, mcafeepaying[.]com, and in DarkHotel domains: secureonline[.]net, checkingvirusscan[.]com. <<|needle|>> Basically, they are targeting the victim’s lack of tech knowledge—advertising to upgrade the security of their system would obviously be a priority for a high-level executive or politician.\nAnother feature of DarkHotel domains that we analyzed were their ASN (Autonomous System Number). <<|needle|>>We found that a lot of these domains come from obscure ASNs/registrars that were previously associated with domains exhibiting malicious behavior. <<|needle|>>Generally, malicious domains like these are associated with lesser-known ASNs/Orgs, and have very limited restrictions on abuse. <<|needle|>>Here are the top 10 ASNs the DarkHotel domains were associated with:One example of a potential abuse-detection mechanism we found when researching DarkHotel domain/ASN mappings is the domain microsoft-xupdate[.]info. <<|needle|>>If this domain really was a Microsoft update tool, wouldn’t it make sense for it to come from an ASN or Registrar associated with Microsoft, like ASN 8075, Microsoft Corporation? However, it’s associated with ASN 21740, eNom Incorporation, whose rank is 6135—which raises some suspicion.\nSimilar logic can be applied to adobeplugs[.]net which comes from ASN 3388, LeaseWeb, or adobeupdates[.]com from ASN 53665,  Bodis. <<|needle|>>Why would it not be associated with Adobe Systems, whose ASN is 1313? These inconsistencies definitely lead to more suspicion about these domains.\nWe also used GeoIP/MaxMind to do country code lookups on the DarkHotel domains, and here are some of our top results:\nUnited States: 113\nNetherlands: 47\nUK: 27\nGermany: 19\nMalaysia: 16\nThailand: 6\nSwitzerland: 6\nIt is interesting to see that several of them are from the US, since most of the reported attacks are from East Asia. <<|needle|>>Generally though, these country stats are pretty consistent with APT behavior, a lot of which resolve to locations in the U.S. <<|needle|>>Here is the geographic breakdown:We also mined another data set associated with these DarkHotel domains—their WHOIS records. <<|needle|>>Interestingly, we found that many of the domains have been updated very recently. <<|needle|>>A majority of the domains have been updated in the last few months, and some within the last few weeks. <<|needle|>>This is generally not the case when dealing with legitimate domains (ex. <<|needle|>>Alexa Top 1000) that very rarely update their domain registration records.\nThis is another indicator of abuse, as attackers have to constantly evolve to stay ahead of detection mechanisms. <<|needle|>>Another curious fact: although the domains were updated recently, many of these domains were created quite some time ago. <<|needle|>>Here are some our domain results with particularly old creation dates and very recent modification dates:\nDomains: microchsse[.]strangled[.]net, www[.]strangled[.]net, automobiles[.]strangled[.]net\nCreation time: 9/24/1999\nUpdate time: 9/9/2014\nDomains: microblo5[.]mooo[.]com, microchisk[.]mooo[.]com\nCreation time: 3/24/2000\nUpdate time: 3/8/2014\nDomain: codec[.]servepics[.]com\nCreation time: 6/1/2001\nUpdate time: 8/15/2014\nDomain: www[.]universalonline[.]com\nCreation time: 3/12/2000\nUpdate time: 2/11/2014\nDomain: redlooksman[.]servehttp[.]com\nCreation time: 8/1/2000\nUpdate time: 8/13/2014\nSeveral of these domain creation dates span back over 10 years with some dating as far back as 1999. <<|needle|>>This suggests that the DarkHotel campaign may in fact have been going on for longer than we expected. <<|needle|>>It’s intriguing to see these old creation dates alongside the recently updated information, which implies these domains are being routinely maintained. <<|needle|>>This deserves further investigation, and could potentially be used as another detection mechanism.\nAfter analyzing these results, we have come to the conclusion that there are certain patterns in DarkHotel domain data, and that threat actors are replicating proven tactics. <<|needle|>> The next step would be to program these findings into a feature detection algorithm and apply deeper inspection of our results.\nThe text analysis of the domain and ASN information seemed to be the most revealing, and promising for feature detection. <<|needle|>>While the geo-diversity analysis was interesting to see, it did not reveal enough info to convert into a feature. <<|needle|>>The recently updated WHOIS records, and the fact that many of these domains have been created quite some time ago is also fascinating, but deserves deeper analysis before turning into a feature.Fine with me, explain what new gamemode you guys want considering how. <<|needle|>>Every platform will be used for the tournaments, meaning that Fortnite matchmaking region explained regioh will be.\n\nFailure to use the correct matchmaking region in-game will result in a forfeit..

humanity, along with the first religious experience and birth of the new life. <<|needle|>>Needless to say, every culture has accumulated a set of rules and customs to initiate the start of couple’s life as one whole. <<|needle|>>Let’s look at the traditional wedding in Ukraine, which unravels many cultural layers and secrets.\n\nUkrainian wedding is made up from a whole lot of traditions, and if some of them date back to several centuries ago, others came all the way from the ancient times. <<|needle|>>Naturally, most of the traditions that are inherent in modern weddings are very different from the latter. <<|needle|>>Some of them, however, people managed to save till nowadays. <<|needle|>>For instance, the tradition of pouring wine and breaking the glass ‘for the fortune’ originates from the Slavic god of the Sun.\n\nPouring a drink, we subconsciously make a sacrifice to the Sun, and breaking the glass symbolizes that no mortal can ever drink from the bowl the Sun drank. <<|needle|>>In the pre-Christian period, Ukrainians married in the spring. <<|needle|>>It was considered the most favorable time for the formation of a new family. <<|needle|>>With the advent of Christianity, this tradition has changed because of the Great Lent. <<|needle|>>Moreover, until 19th century the church marriage was only a legal necessity — thus, young people could live separately for a few years before they finally celebrate the wedding.\n\nUkrainian wedding ceremony was – and sometimes, still is – more of the theatrical performance than a strict ceremony. <<|needle|>>The permanent ‘cast’ consists of the future couple, their parents, groomsmen called ‘boyary’, bridesmaids called ‘druzhky’, and guests of the wedding. <<|needle|>>Typically villages had their own zealots of the wedding ceremony, who guided the course of the action. <<|needle|>>Each participant then had to know what to say and when to sing. <<|needle|>>Given that the whole village was invited to wedding, along with the bride’s and groom’s relatives, no wonder the wedding ceremony began much earlier and ended much later than just the wedding day. <<|needle|>>Now, let’s take a look at the stages of the typical Ukrainian wedding.Everything started with engagement — sometimes the parents arranged it themselves, but more often the young man and the girl agreed beforehand, and then informed their parents about it. <<|needle|>>A future groom along with his uncle (or his father, or a respectable man in the village) went to the girl’s parents to negotiate the time of matchmaking. <<|needle|>>If the girl’s parents didn’t like the candidate, they refused or set up conditions.\n\nIf everything went good, then was the showing, or ‘ohliadyny’ — the young man’s parents went to the girl’s house in order to see the household, assess the wealth of the future bride and meet her parents. <<|needle|>>The girl had to present the best version of herself, be hospitable with the guests and prove that she would be a good hostess. <<|needle|>>If the young man’s parents were not happy with what they saw, they could forbid their son to marry this girl.Next one of the most well-known ceremonies in traditional Ukrainian wedding happened – matchmaking. <<|needle|>>The groom picked matchmakers among his closest friends, who then went to the bride’s house to make a preliminary marriage agreement. <<|needle|>>The date of matchmaking was kept secret, as well as the route the messengers chose to get to the goal. <<|needle|>>It was believed that the faster the matchmakers make it from the gates to the girl’s house, the sooner the parents will consent to marriage. <<|needle|>>Often matchmaking didn’t end in anything from the first try.\n\nThis did not mean, however, that parents were against the marriage. <<|needle|>>Sometimes they simply did not want to hurry to give their daughter away. <<|needle|>>If the girl herself doesn’t consent to marry, she brought a pumpkin to the one who wished to marry her as a token of refusal.Dr. <<|needle|>>Zhang publishes before Dr. <<|needle|>>Li. <<|needle|>>If everything was alright, it was the time for the young man’s parents to come over for the matchmaking. <<|needle|>>They discussed the wedding, expenses, dowry of the bride, her responsibilities in the new family.Preparation for the wedding usually lasted a long time. <<|needle|>>Thus, the bride’s family cleaned the house, prepared the dowry and cooked food – up to twenty dishes. <<|needle|>>Among them was the traditional Ukrainian wedding cake – Korovai. <<|needle|>>It was baked both in the houses of the groom and the bride. <<|needle|>>Families invited korovainytsi – three to seven young, happily married women. <<|needle|>>Curiously, women who weren’t married well couldn’t take part in this ceremony – according to the wedding superstitions in Ukraine, the bride then would be divorced or widowed. <<|needle|>>Korovai was decorated with periwinkle — a symbol of eternal love, and kalyna, which symbolized the woman’s ability to give birth.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the bride and chief bridesmaid invited matchmakers and groomsmen to weave the hiltse — a tree branch, decorated with flowers, ribbons and various herbs. <<|needle|>>It was then stuck in the fresh bread that traditionally was among the dishes of the Ukrainian wedding. <<|needle|>>On the evening before the wedding, the bride said farewell to the unmarried life. <<|needle|>>Her friends gathered at her house and sang songs about beauty, youth and the future good-byes to the parents.Finally, it was time for the wedding. <<|needle|>>It usually happened on Sunday. <<|needle|>>In the morning, the bride was preparing for marriage: her braids were undone (often by her brother), friends put in coins and colorful ribbons in her hair. <<|needle|>>Garlic was traditionally put in the Ukrainian wedding clothing as a symbol of protection. <<|needle|>>Throughout the centuries-old history, every detail of the garment was made according to the folk traditions. <<|needle|>>It was meant to serve one high purpose: to protect the spouses from evil forces, provide happy future.\n\nTraditional Ukrainian dress worn by the bride and the groom’s garments differed from region to region, but in the end each wedding clothing was meant to show people the couple’s honesty, skills in work, and thus to testify to their maturity and readiness to create their own family. <<|needle|>>When the young man came over to the bride’s house, the bridegroom stood on a towel, which symbolized that life would be long and smooth. <<|needle|>>The parents blessed the couple, crossing them with the icons three times.Dr. <<|needle|>>Li publishes after Dr. <<|needle|>>Wang.Dr. <<|needle|>>Wang publishes after Dr. <<|needle|>>Zhang.<image>Having received the parental blessing, groom and bride, along with the whole marriage procession went to the church to marry. <<|needle|>>Traditional Ukrainian songs were performed all the way until the wedding took place. <<|needle|>>After the ceremony, the newly-weds returned to the husband’s house for a meal. <<|needle|>>They were met with bread and salt put on a towel. <<|needle|>>Similar ceremonies meant to unify the family lasted for a long time.\n\nFinally, after the first month of a married life, the final wedding ceremony was held. <<|needle|>>It has a unique name in different regions — Kalachiny in Hutsul region, Dyaka in Lviv region, Khliba in Volyn, and Vytratnyi Borsch in other regions. <<|needle|>>A young man invited his parents and his wife, as well as other relatives, to an abundant feast in honor of the prosperity of their family and household. <<|needle|>>Ukrainian wedding presents also carried symbolism — traditionally, the smith of the village would give the newlyweds a horseshoe as a talisman for the wealth, luck and fortune. <<|needle|>>Sometimes the gifts included scissors — its two halves working as one symbolized the new family. <<|needle|>>Curiously, the gifts weren’t meant only for the bride — during the wedding ceremony, groom gave scarves or decorations for bride’s sisters, and traditional Ukrainian boots for the mother-in-law.\n\nNaturally, not all regions of Ukraine have the same traditions, but the main ceremonies have been passed through the years and even centuries to be revived nowadays.\nPhoto source: shutterstock.com. <<|needle|>>All images belong to their rightful authors.Smoth..you know that your stuff is screaming to be turned into

lands and a Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar, and throughout the game, they take turns discarding lands to generate token copies of random creatures. <<|needle|>>It’s a swingy format, and as a competitive player who aims to minimize Magic’s inherent variance, I was surprised by how much I ended up enjoying it. <<|needle|>>There’s something delightful about spinning the wheel and seeing a creature you didn’t even know existed appear on your side of the battlefield.The entire Momir set, in all its color-coded glory. <<|needle|>>(Photo credit: Chris Rowlands)\n\nMomir draws from a pool of tens of thousands of creatures, so it’s nearly impossible to replicate the experience with paper Magic cards – but that hasn’t stopped a few intrepid players from trying. <<|needle|>>Here in Seattle, where Card Kingdom has its offices, we’re fortunate enough to have one of those players in our midst. <<|needle|>>If you live in the area, you may have even seen Del Johnston set up shop at Mox Boarding House Seattle, where he often meets with friends to play tabletop RPGs and board games. <<|needle|>>Every so often, Del brings along his curated Momir Basic set – a collection of over 400 creatures in piles of color-coded sleeves – and challenges players to duel. <<|needle|>>Last month, we posted a photo of Del’s Momir set-up on our Twitter account, and our community was so eager learn more about his creation that we decided to call him in for an interview.\n\nOf course, to get the full Momir experience, I just had to play a few games with Del – and, of course, some of those games were comically lopsided. <<|needle|>>In the first game, I paid two mana and got a copy of Walking Atlas, which would enable me to ramp into enormous creatures; in another, I got a Tempting Wurm for the same cost, and Del was four land-drops ahead of me for the rest of the game. <<|needle|>>Del intentionally included these powerful “bombs” and detrimental “bricks” in his Momir collection to make the games feel as uncertain as possible.\n\n“I included some incredibly powerful and one-sided cards that basically say ‘Win target game’,” Del said. <<|needle|>>“I want players who feel like they don’t have an out to know that, if they believe in the heart of the cards, they can flip something game-changing.”"}

the effect of disturbances on the essential variables is reduced by an active regulator .The experiments were carried out with in-door Pneumatic 6/12-feet helium Gun Facility in the Vibration and Noise Control Laboratory at University of Maryland; it has a stainless steel tube length of 6 feet. <<|needle|>>The detailed description is found in part 1, Eldalil and Baz [16].\n\nThe piezoelectric stack and shell tube combination is shown in Figure 5. <<|needle|>>As indicated in part 1 [16], the stiffeners are composed of three parts, two half rings , in Figure 5, and one outer ring, surrounding the shell tube ; consequently, in active control, the outer ring is removed and the stacks are rested on the upper and lower half rings. <<|needle|>>A stainless steel clamp strip is used to hold the components fixed in position, and the screw is used to create initial tension in the clamp strip and consequently generates compression force distributed around the shell tube substituting the removed outer ring of the stiffener.The measurements are carried out at two operating helium pressures, 1600 and 2000 psi, and the controller (piezo-stack) is installed very close to location number 2 on the gun tube, as indicated in part 1 [16]. <<|needle|>>The expected deforming vibration due to these pressures ranges between 7.2 and 25 kHz, Part 1 [16], that is, far enough from the first mode frequency of the piezoelectric stack (64 kHz), as shown in Figure 2.Figure 9\nTime domain comparison between active and stiffened tube at location no. <<|needle|>>2 at operating pressure 1600 psi.<image>Figure 13\nComparison between piezoelectric sensor and amplified signals at amplifier gain factor of 2.\n\nThe radial strain vibration is attenuated by using the active piezoelectric control by a ratio of 46% at vibration mode of 7.2 kHz and 65% at 9.5 kHz. <<|needle|>>The attenuation ratio is increased at higher pressure level of 2000 psi than at pressure level of 1600 psi, by a value of 40% for the first mode and by 35% for the second mode of vibrations. <<|needle|>>The frequency is shifted to lower values by about 13%. <<|needle|>>This due to increasing the control effort nonlinearly with strain deformations which are occurred at the two pressure levels of the first and second experiments;

What influence did such German and Austrian occult leaders as Lanz von Liebenfels and Guido von List have over the fledgling Nazi party? What was the Thule Gesellschaft, and who was its creator, Baron von Sebottendorf? Did the Nazi high command really believe in occultism? In astrology? In magic and reincarnation?

rental companies are now able to do more with less.\n\nLindsey Anderson has been the Editor for Access, Lift, and Handlers (ALH) Magazine for 11 years. <<|needle|>>She joined KHL, the parent company of ALH, in 2008 and has been closely covering the lift and access industry since. <<|needle|>>She has grown the magazine to eight issues a year and started the ALH Conference & Awards four years ago.\n\nAnderson has also orchestrated three “top lists” a year, ranking mast climber, telehandler, and aerial rentals by size of fleet. <<|needle|>>She has spent the last decade meeting with and interviewing manufacturing and rental leaders in the aerial lift and material handling space.\n\nI sat with Anderson to get her predictions on the future of lift and access equipment and how rental companies will adapt.\n\n“The biggest change I see with rental companies is that everything used to be done on paper. <<|needle|>>Now, everything from ordering to asset management is going digital,” says Anderson.\n\nEnd users now want to get as much done on their own before talking to a salesperson. <<|needle|>>In fact, buyers prefer to self-educate versus talk to a sales rep by a factor of 3 to 1 across all other B2B transactions. <<|needle|>>This trend has made its way to equipment.\n\nFor the most effective rental companies, digitization of sales and operations is embraced as workforce enablement as opposed to workforce replacement.\n\nWith the implementation of e-commerce, for example, sales reps can eliminate wasted time on order processing and focus on building customer relationships.\n\nCRM systems allow businesses to track the type of customers they serve and the frequency of their transactions in order to make better decisions about their fleet composition.\n\nThis most tangible signs that times are changing are what is going on with rental companies like United Rentals, marketplaces like BigRentz, and part suppliers like Grainger.\n\nThe digitization of commerce, asset management, and operations will need to be adopted out of necessity for rental companies to remain competitive in the changing equipment rental landscape.\n\nHowever, we still have a long way to go.\n\nIt’s estimated that less than 50% of heavy equipment and tool rental businesses use some sort of rental management software.\n\nBeyond the adoption of currently available tools, the future of construction tech is complete vertical integration between each silo from equipment rental e-commerce to asset management, to customer relationship management to project management.\n\nThe rapid M&A activity in the construction tech space is a leading indicator that larger tech companies are beginning to think about “owning more of the process.”\n\nThere are still many disconnects but expect more of the gaps to be bridged in the coming years.\n\n“We are witnessing amazing advancement in telematics. <<|needle|>>Just about every OEM has either partnered with a third-party provider or created their own telematics system,” says Anderson.\n\nAccording to the ARA, 72% of larger contractors with 50 employees or more said they were familiar with telematics.\n\n“Before, telematics was primarily used for tracking equipment. <<|needle|>>Now, everything from battery levels to hydraulic fluid levels can be monitored to help prevent maintenance. <<|needle|>>I am really impressed with how much telematics has changed over the last five years,” adds Anderson.\n\nSkyJack Elevate, Genie Lift Connect, and JLG ClearSky have all been announced in the past year to help rental companies maximize asset utilization and uptime.\n\n“You do not need to be a national rental company to reap the benefits of telematics data. <<|needle|>>I was with Bob Kendall, President of Star Rentals, who said his business has gone from zero to full implementation of telematics data into their operations to be smarter around fleet management,” says Anderson.\n\nTelematics is being implemented into components of equipment as well.\n\nFor example, Perkins Engines recently launched the Perkins SmartCap which monitors your engine and sends usage data straight to your smartphone enabling mechanics in the field to be more effective with preventative maintenance and part ordering.\n\nWith the amount of data being collected from the equipment coupled with fully integrated data visualization platforms will begin to change the way rental companies think about acquiring, managing, and maintaining their equipment.\n\n“With the new ANSI standards, training is going to be required for MEWP operators. <<|needle|>>Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are really new to the industry but quickly going to change how training is delivered,” says Anderson.\n\nFor example, Serious Labs, in collaboration with Skyjack and Nationwide Platforms, launched the MEWP VR Simulator to provide a virtual aerial operator training solution for the rental industry. <<|needle|>>This allows trainers to safely put trainees in high-risk situations in order to develop safety skills without the risk of physical harm.\n\n“With these online courses and simulators (United Rentals has quite a few), you don’t have to drive to sit in a classroom for six hours. <<|needle|>>You can complete the classroom portions on your own time,” says Anderson.\n\nThe industry continues to innovate around operator safety and adoption should only increase.\n\nIn early 2019, both Skyjack and JLG debuted their own autonomous loading and unloading equipment.\n\nJLG released their R Series scissor lift which allows driving, steering, and loading to be done via mobile app. <<|needle|>>This adds a layer of safety and versatility for operators navigating in tight corridors or in risky loading and unloading conditions.\n\nSkyJack demonstrated their completely autonomous SJ3215 at the 2019 ARA Show in Anaheim as part of their autonomous equipment research initiative.\n\n“Autonomous loading and unloading adds to the safety of our job sites and rental yards so I see more autonomy happening for these use cases,” says Anderson.\n\nSome of the larger equipment rental companies are already embracing autonomous equipment.\n\nFor example, Sunstate announced a partnership with Built Robotics to test their line of autonomous equipment with customers over the next 12 months.\n\nThe economic and safety benefits coupled with the labor shortage in construction makes autonomous equipment an exciting opportunity. <<|needle|>>Although we are still a ways off from fully autonomous job sites, there are lots of applications that can create incremental improvements to the safety of the handling and delivery of equipment.\n\nJLG released their 3rd quarter results which showed a 42% increase in telehandler sales over their first 9 months of FY 2019 versus the same nine-month period last year. <<|needle|>>Meanwhile, aerial sales grew just over 1%.\n\n“Telehandlers, with their increasing number of attachments, have been able to fill gaps in product lines and have quickly become the first one on and the last one off jobsites. <<|needle|>>More and more units are coming into the field that can operate as the jack of all trades, even replacing a lot of crane work in urban areas,” notes Anderson.\n\nIn fact, according to GlobalNewsWire, the telehandler market is expected to experience a 5% growth rate from 2019 – 2029 and reach a $4B market size in 2019.\n\nThe shift towards telehandlers is hard to ignore. <<|needle|>>This could be an indication that equipment rental companies, especially among the independents, are now able to do more with less so, therefore, focusing on equipment with more utility versus specialization.\n\n“Independents are on fire. <<|needle|>>Chicago’s Lizzy Lift reported a 53% increase in rentals, Cooper Equipment Rentals 37%, Battlefield Equipment Rentals 11% to name a few. <<|needle|>>They are quickly growing their fleets while some OEMs, like Snorkel, narrow their focus on independents,” says Anderson.\n\nTelehandlers can be one of those areas of opportunity.\n\n“We are seeing a huge shift towards electric and hybrid fleets. <<|needle|>>For instance, Haulotte, who just achieved their best quarter in 10 years, announced at Intermat that moving forward all of their machines will be electric with the introduction of the Pulseo generation. <<|needle|>>Manitou also released their Oxygen line, making them the first OEM to have a hybrid and electric telehandler,” says Anderson.\n\nHybrid and electric vehicles are also getting larger. <<|needle|>>With rough terrain lifts and telehandlers already in circulation, it is safe to expect electric applications to grow into heavier weight classes.\n\nThey are a win economically by lowering the total cost of ownership.\n\nThey are a win environmentally by reducing emissions.\n\nAnd they are a win in quiet environments and emerging markets.\n\n“OEMs are going smaller, not bigger. <<|needle|>>No one has it in their plans to go bigger i.e. <<|needle|>>with a 190ft – 200ft boom. <<|needle|>>Instead, Genie, MEC, and Snorkel came out with a 13-foot lift. <<|needle|>>Hy-Brid came out with a line of pusharounds as a replacement to ladders. <<|needle|>>No one is looking to reinvent the wheel with the bread and butter of boom lifts and scissors, more so coming out with more compact, cleaner options,” says Anderson.\n\nLindsey Anderson broke down her six predictions for the future of the equipment side of the construction industry:\n\nTechnology needs to be thought of as workforce enablement, not as workforce replacement. <<|needle|>>To date, there is a reluctance to adopt technology on the commerce side of the business either out of fear of being replaced, satisfaction with the status quo, or a lack of urgency to innovate.\n\nThe use of technology and the data that comes with it allows equipment rental companies and operators to focus more time and energy on the human element of the business that has built this industry.\n\nIt allows us to be smarter around our economic decision making, more efficient with our sales and fulfillment, and more personalized with the customer experience we provide.\n\nThe biggest shift is in our perception of technology and our behavior as consumers of it.How

due to chargebacks. <<|needle|>>What started as a legal mechanism to protect shoppers from fraud has become a constant threat to the profitability of online merchants, as well as a hassle for the consumers who should benefit from it.\n\nLet’s have a look at how the chargeback process works and why merchants should always keep the number of chargeback requests opened against them at a minimum.\n\nWhat is a chargeback?\n\nLet’s start with the chargeback definition:\n\nA chargeback is a transaction in which an issuing bank pulls funds from a merchant and gives them back to a consumer. <<|needle|>>This usually occurs because the consumer has escalated a dispute about a purchase to their bank for resolution.\n\nA chargeback is different from a refund. <<|needle|>>Instead of contacting the merchant from which the purchase was made and requesting a refund, a shopper can go directly to their bank and request that the funds be removed from the merchant’s account.\n\nThe chargeback process was designed to protect shoppers from fraud or unscrupulous merchants. <<|needle|>>Credit or debit card crime is still rampant today – thieves or cybercriminals may obtain and use a person’s card details to make all sorts of payments,  the cardholder unaware until informed by the issuing bank or checking their account. <<|needle|>>At that stage, the cardholder can ask the issuing bank for a chargeback. <<|needle|>>The bank will investigate the transaction in question and, if fraud is suspected, will forcibly remove the funds from the merchants’ account and return them to the cardholder’s account.\n\nChargebacks are also meant to deter merchants from engaging in unethical or fraudulent practices. <<|needle|>>These might include delivering products that don’t match the advertised specifications or are defective, accepting payments but not fulfilling the orders, or adding hidden extra charges to the shopper’s card. <<|needle|>>Since dissatisfied customers have the possibility to request their money back by sidestepping the seller altogether, eCommerce companies will normally try to provide the best products and services to their clients.What are the most frequent causes of chargeback requests?Card Not Present (CNP) fraud is the biggest source of chargebacks according to 48% of merchants, followed by friendly fraud (28%) and then account takeover fraud (7%). <<|needle|>>However, the same study revealed that 12% of merchants don’t know why they are confronted by chargeback requests, which is rather worrying.\n\nThe two most common chargeback reasons we at 2Checkout have observed are fraud and order not recognized. <<|needle|>>The latter occurs when the shopper doesn’t recall placing a new order or doesn’t recognize a transaction that is listed on their bank statement. <<|needle|>>It is often related to subscriptions with recurring billing. <<|needle|>>Most customers don’t know they agreed to be automatically billed for a product or service, often because they just checked a box in the shopping cart without really reading it, or because the box was pre-checked and they didn’t realize what it meant. <<|needle|>>Therefore, they will dispute the charge.\n\nFraud is harder to detect and fight, as it can take many complex forms. <<|needle|>>Card Not Present (CNP) payment fraud has exploded in recent years, mainly due to the growth of eCommerce, mobile payments, and data breaches that have exposed shoppers’ data to fraudsters. <<|needle|>>However, clean fraud (when a criminal uses someone else’s data to pay), account takeover, or identity fraud together account for only 30% of online merchants’ fraud losses.\n\nChargeback fraud and friendly fraud are responsible for the remaining 70% of fraud losses. <<|needle|>>Friendly fraud happens when a family member buys something using the shopper’s payment card without them being aware of it. <<|needle|>>Therefore, when the card holder sees the unknown order on their card statement, they open a chargeback request. <<|needle|>>Chargeback fraud, on the other hand, involves a shopper intentionally misusing their chargeback rights to both retain a purchased item and get their money back for it as well. <<|needle|>>The increased consumer awareness of their chargeback rights and ease of disputing a charge, coupled with the difficulty merchants have in fighting chargebacks, has led to an escalation in chargeback fraud in recent years. <<|needle|>>Understandably, this has a considerable negative impact on the merchants’ bottom line and the eCommerce climate overall.\n\nThe impact of chargebacks<image>The average eCommerce chargeback rate for merchants using the 2Checkout digital commerce platform is between 0.3% and 0.4%. <<|needle|>>Why is that important? A healthy chargeback rate has to be below 1%. <<|needle|>>Rates exceeding this number iare considered unacceptable by most payment processors, leading to merchant account termination.\n\nUnfortunately, nowadays most merchants do not achieve their chargeback rate targets, which costs them a great deal. <<|needle|>>For example, last year almost 70% of companies aimed for an optimum chargeback rate below 0.5%, but only about 46% of them achieved that. <<|needle|>>The more ambitious companies targeted rates of less than 0.1%, but only 18% managed to reach those goals.\n\nEvery chargeback request, legitimate or not, brings merchants one step closer to being fined or even losing their merchant accounts with the acquiring banks. <<|needle|>>Depending on the card association’s rules, fines imposed on merchants for going over certain chargeback rate thresholds can extend up to $10,000 or more. <<|needle|>>Continued overstepping of chargeback rate limits will then lead to merchant account termination and possibly inclusion on MasterCard’s MATCH list, which will forbid the business from obtaining another regular merchant account with acquiring banks for five years. <<|needle|>>Businesses that find themselves in such a situation often have no recourse but to apply for high risk merchant accounts, which usually come with steep costs that further erode the merchant’s profitability.\n\nThe negative impact of chargebacks is compounded by the fact that only 18% of the merchants who fight chargebacks actually win most of those disputes. <<|needle|>>What’s more, 11% of online sellers do not even attempt to represent chargebacks, believing that the cost/benefit ratio of such an effort is not in their favor.\n\nNevertheless, merchants can – and should – do what they can to prevent chargebacks from being levied against them. <<|needle|>>Doing so will not only help them avoid significant profit losses, but also contribute to the health of global commerce overall.\n\nSo how do you prevent chargebacks in 2019? It all comes down to providing a great customer experience, with effective and timely communication towards the shopper, transparency, responsiveness in customer service, and features and policies that encourage customer retention and discourage fraud.\n\nTo find out more about chargebacks and learn the most effective tactics and strategies to prevent them (and thus reduce your chargeback rate), download our free ebook on Understanding Chargebacks, here.How to Handle the Complexity of Cross-Border Payments\nRead moreHow to Protect Your Online Businesses from Phishing Attacks\nRead moreA few weeks ago, photographer Steve Rotman released San Francisco Street Art,  bringing to life The Bay Area’s vibrant underground art world. <<|needle|>>Rotman has been working obsessively for almost five years on this latest project, which takes you on an oft not seen side of San Francisco’s back alleys, “chill spots”, and grimier neighborhood walls and sidewalks. <<|needle|>>The official book-release is Monday, May 11th at Books Inc. <<|needle|>>Opera Plaza on Van Ness Street in San Francisco, where several of the featured artists will be available to talk about their work.\n\nI recently sat down with Steve and talked about his new book, and the politics of San Francisco graffiti…\n\nTroy Holden: San Francisco City officials claim graffiti complaints are way up this year. <<|needle|>>They claim The City is overwhelmed with graffiti removal requests from private citizens and business owners. <<|needle|>>Is there really more graffiti now than there was five years ago?\n\nSteve: No, not even close! In fact, San Francisco’s never been more graffiti-free, thanks to several years of aggressive buffing. <<|needle|>>Just a few years ago, graffiti was ubiquitous: there were big colorful rooftop pieces in almost every neighborhood, parking lots were layered with years of history, business roll-down gates featured a steady rotation of throw-ups, there were doors crushed with tags citywide, and several Muni tunnels were painted end to end. <<|needle|>>Almost none of that exists anymore. <<|needle|>>The amount of graffiti today is exponentially less. <<|needle|>>It raises an obvious question: what’s all the fuss about?\n\nTroy Holden: To address these concerns, City Officials recently held an Anti-Graffiti “Super Huddle” with the lofty goal of eliminating all graffiti in The City once and for all. <<|needle|>>Is that realistic? If these proposed enforcement/abatement efforts take effect, will there be anything left for you to photograph?\n\nSteve: Gosh, let’s hope so, otherwise I’ll have to find a new hobby! No, seriously, the idea of “Zero Graffiti” is just silly. <<|needle|>>Graffiti has been a vital part of San Francisco for more than three decades. <<|needle|>>Even with the aggressive buffing over the last few years, there’s still plenty of good graffiti here and I expect there will be for a long time to come.“Disobey” as shot by Steve Rotman\n\nTroy Holden: City officials say all we need to know about graffiti is that it’s illegal and it’s vandalism. <<|needle|>>What do you think?\n\nSteve: That’s simplistic. <<|needle|>>Graffiti is obviously much more than criminal. <<|needle|>>It’s a worldwide renegade art culture that’s been around for decades. <<|needle|>>Graffiti is routinely exhibited in museums and art galleries all over the world. <<|needle|>>Bookstores feature shelves full of graffiti and street art collections. <<|needle|>>Graffiti festivals are commonplace. <<|needle|>>Graffiti-inspired designs infuse popular culture. <<|needle|>>Why? Because people enjoy it!\n\nTroy Holden: City authorities insist a lot of graffiti is created by gangbangers and thugs. <<|needle|>>You’ve spent a lot of time around graffiti and graffiti artists. <<|needle|>>What do you think of this nonsense?\n\nSteve: Look, I’ve heard this propaganda about graffiti and gangs for a long time. <<|needle|>>It’s comical. <<|needle|>>It’s basically a way to scare the public and vilify graffiti. <<|needle|>>I’ve come to know the local graffiti culture very well. <<|needle|>>I’ve yet to meet a single graffiti writer who strikes me as gang affiliated. <<|needle|>>Graffiti writers love graffiti and art. <<|needle|>>They’re into creating art on the streets. <<|needle|>>Their passion is graffiti, not gangbanging.“Defie” as shot by Steve Rotman\n\nSteve: That’s a great question. <<|needle|>>It’s easy to get the two confused because both categories are usually illegal. <<|needle|>>I see them as two different varieties of urban expression. <<|needle|>>Graffiti is about stylistically and competitively “getting up”– writing a name over and over, usually with spray paint or markers. <<|needle|>>It mainly involves creation of stylized letter forms through tags, throw-ups, and pieces. <<|needle|>>Street art is more about creating a message or imagery through stencils, stickers, wheat-pastes or murals. <<|needle|>>For outsiders, graffiti tends to look more alien because the letters can be tough to read. <<|needle|>>Street art is more accessible. <<|needle|>>That said, there’s definitely some crossover between the two.\n\nTroy Holden: Some people see tagging as “scrawls and scribbles.” You also shoot photos of tags. <<|needle|>>Why?\n\nSteve: I like tags. <<|needle|>>I’ve learned that they’re a key element of graffiti and I appreciate tagging as a form of urban calligraphy. <<|needle|>>Well crafted tags reflect individual style. <<|needle|>>To create a really impressive tag requires great skill and technique.<image>“Pose 2” as shot by Steve Rotman\n\nTroy Holden: What are some good locations to get a taste of the urban art you’ve been documenting in San Francisco?\n\nSteve: Just for starters, I’d suggest Clarion Alley between Valencia and Mission streets. <<|needle|>>Also in the Mission, Lilac Alley between 24th and 26th streets. <<|needle|>>In the Soma district, Bluxome Alley at roughly 430 Townsend street. <<|needle|>>And in the Upper Haight, check out the Amoeba Records parking lot.\n\nTroy Holden: Word up, thanks Steve.Serving up 11 incredible octopus recipes for you to indulge in\n\nIt gets a bad rep and it’s daunting as hell to try to cook, but octopus is… ahem… making waves.\n\nWhen cooked right and with the best ingredients, its tender meat is almost unmatched. <<|needle|>>And what’s even better is that cooking it can be approached in a whole range of ways.\n\nBut don’t let that put you off today! Today we’re writing in defense of the underrated dish.\n\nIt’s one of those foods that can vary wildly from amazing to very, very bad. <<|needle|>>When done wrong, it can be overly tough and chewy, which might well be one of the things that puts people off. <<|needle|>>However, when done right, it has a similar taste to lobster.\n\nIt’s often confused with calamari, which is in fact squid. <<|needle|>>Where squid tends to differ is that it’s usually a much tougher meat. <<|needle|>>As well as this, its flesh tends to be much smoother than that of an octopus. <<|needle|>>Basically, they don’t taste that alike. <<|needle|>>Octopus is only tough when not cooked properly, and therein lies the appeal of the meat.\n\nTo help show the amazing versatility of the meat, here are 11 incredible octopus recipes to whet your appetite.Check it out at My Greek Dish“The secret to cooking octopus is to go long and slow. <<|needle|>>Octopi don’t like to be rushed, but the window of perfection is a small one – cooked to quick and it remains tough, to long and it turns to mush. <<|needle|>>Get it right and its succulent, tender with just enough bite to chew.Our eight legged aquatic creature is very versatile; great braised and marinated served chilled or cooked in a hearty stew but my favourite is grilled till crispy with a simple squeeze of lemon… Enjoy!”\n\nCheck it out at Theo CooksCheck it out at Brad A. <<|needle|>>JohnsonCheck it out at Hispanic KitchenCheck it out at Jeanette’s Healthy LivingCheck it out at Simply RecipesCheck it out at Just One Cookbook<image>Check it out at Seonkyoung LongestCheck it out at Leite’s CulinariaCheck it out at Helen GravesThe hearing comes more than a month after Mr Floyd was killed while in police custody in Minneapolis.A Minnesota judge on Monday warned that he's likely to move the trials of four police officers charged in George Floyd's death out of Minneapolis if public officials and attorneys don't stop talking about the case.\n\nHennepin County Judge Peter Cahill stopped short of issuing a gag order on attorneys, but he said one is likely if public statements continue.\n\nCahill added that such a situation would also make him likely to grant a change-of-venue motion if one is filed.\n\n\"The court is not going to be happy about hearing about the case in three areas: media, evidence and guilt or innocence,\" Cahill said.It was the second pretrial hearing for the officers, who were fired after Floyd's May 25 death.\n\nDerek Chauvin, 44, is charged with second-degree murder and other counts, while Thomas Lane, 37, J Kueng, 26, and Tou Thao, 34, are charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin.<image>The officers were responding to a call about a man trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store.\n\nHis family spoke outside the court.\n\nHis aunt, Angela Harrelson said they didn't like the fact they were \"asked not to respond in a certain way.\n\n\"So I think my nephew's case is gonna be a fight. <<|needle|>>This is going to be a heavy fight, I see it right away,\" she said.\n\nHis uncle, Selwyn Jones said he was \"mad at the system,\" adding, \"How do you kill.... I mean how do you control a situation anymore than you had it controlled.\n\n\"He's handcuffed, on his stomach, hands behind his back. <<|needle|>>What was he going to do? Hell, he couldn't get up and run. <<|needle|>>We all sat there and just watched him get brutally tortured and murdered.\"\n\nFloyd's death was universally condemned in Minnesota, with elected officials including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey calling for the officers to be charged.Cahill asked Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank to use his influence to keep public officials silent, warning that if they continued to discuss it publicly, he likely would \"have to pull (trials) out of Hennepin County and they need to be aware of that.\"\n\nCahill set a March 8 trial date for the former officers if they are tried together, though he said he expects motions to be filed to separate their trials. <<|needle|>>The next court date is Sept. <<|needle|>>11.The defendants have not entered pleas.\n\nChauvin's attorney has not commented publicly on the charges, while Lane's and Kueng's attorneys have sought to minimise their clients' roles and deflect blame to the more senior Chauvin in Floyd's death, which sparked protests around the world against police brutality.Cahill also rejected a defence request to reconsider his earlier decision to allow cameras in the courtroom during pretrial proceedings. <<|needle|>>Defence attorneys asked to allow such coverage, but prosecutors objected.\n\nThe judge has not ruled on whether to allow cameras for the trial itself, which in Minnesota usually requires the consent of all parties.\n\nKueng's attorney, Tom Plunkett, was the attorney asking Cahill to reconsider his ruling on cameras.\n\nHe asserted that prosecutors and other officials forfeited their right to object to cameras in the courtroom by making public comments that went as far as \"saying the defendants are guilty of murder.\"\n\nHe said allowing electronic coverage of pretrial proceedings would actually make it easier to impanel a fair jury by helping to \"educate the public that there may be more to the cases than what has been told to them by the state.\"The other three former officers are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. <<|needle|>>Those charges are legally tantamount to the counts

tips to get you going.\n(Photos in this blog have been taken using the ComPleater Box available through Amberlane)\n\nBegin by removing all needles not required for pleating your fabric from the machine. <<|needle|>>This saves wear and tear on the needles not being used and could prevent breakage. <<|needle|>>It also allows you to check these needles for a bent one or other damage.\n\nNeedles for most projects are positioned at the ‘non-handle’ end so only the fabric being pleated passes through the machine. <<|needle|>>To thread, pull the thread up from under the needle. <<|needle|>>Pull through the eye of the needle sufficient thread to reach the table top. <<|needle|>>By allowing this amount of thread, you are far less likely to have the thread pull out of the needle(s) when clearing the fabric. <<|needle|>>Threading from the bottom up allows you to easily clear the thread from the needles when pleating is complete. <<|needle|>>But more about that later.On the right is a side view of a Read 16 row pleater mounted on a ComPleater box, pleater tipped up for ease of pleating. <<|needle|>>The fabric is rolled onto a dowel and has started to pass through the machine.\nThe needles in this photo on the left are full and need clearing. <<|needle|>>When this happens, you will find the handle harder to move and the machine will sound like it is starting to ‘thump’. <<|needle|>>Do not force the handle any more. <<|needle|>>Stop and gently ease the fabric off the needles.\n\n\nBelow you see that the fabric has been cleared from the needles so you can carry on pleating.<image>Here the pleating is done and the last of the fabric is cleared from the pleats. <<|needle|>>If you slightly raise the fabric you can slip a finger in between the threads in the needles. <<|needle|>>Keep in mind that the thread on the top of the needles is the short end (not attached to the thead spools) Gently pull up on each of these threads to remove them from the fabric. <<|needle|>>See the close-up below. <<|needle|>>You may wish to put a thumb nail on the needle to give some support while pulling the thread out – just to prevent bent needles.Once the threads are released from the pleater, you can simply pull up and give yourself enough thread to accommodate the letting out of pleats for smocking. <<|needle|>>More will be needed for a bishop but once you have spread the pleats and tied off the threads, you can trim the unwanted ends. <<|needle|>>You will learn to gage how much thread you need but it is better to have more than insufficient.The fabric is positioned to hold 13 rows of gathering threads centered on the fabric. <<|needle|>>Leaving the extra two needles on the ends, ensures more even pleating. <<|needle|>>(I cheated for this and eft all the needles in place.) Below the fabric has been cleared from the needles. <<|needle|>>The pleating is evenly centered.On the right you see the difference in the pleating from the Read to the Sally Stanley. <<|needle|>>The needles of the Sally Stanley are much closer to the center of the pleat and it is more difficult to identify the right and wrong sides. <<|needle|>>The long stitch is still the wrong side. <<|needle|>>Just note that fabric should be pleated with the right side facing up so the gathering threads are slightly to the back of the fabric.Here is another type of insert done on a 24 row Read pleater. <<|needle|>>Sometimes you want to pleat a piece of fabric with the pleating centered in the middle of the fabric, leaving a ruffle on each end (e.g. <<|needle|>>for decorations).\n\nLightly press the fabric in half so you can line up the fabric to a needle or a half space while you are pleating. <<|needle|>>In this example six needles have been threaded up and the fold is lined up to a half-space needle as a guide.\n\nWhatever you choose to pleat, a light shot of spray starch will give you better and crisper pleats. <<|needle|>>Keep your pleater clean and pass some waxed paper through occasionally to lubricate it. <<|needle|>>And most of all, check your needles often for bends or damage. <<|needle|>>Needles should be sharp; keep in mind they don't last forever.\n\nI  hope this is a help to those of you who might have questions about pleating for smocking.\nSo until next time, keep on stitching!!<image>I can honestly say that it was the best day of my life, and in the last two weeks, my whole world has changed for the better. <<|needle|>>I have had many questions regarding my delivery story etc so i will try and give you all as much details as I can.\n\nMy waters broke at home at about 8.30am on Tuesday, after a week of slow labour and constant back pains. <<|needle|>>When my waters broke, I had no contraction pains, so after calling the hospital, I decided I would take my time, have a shower and blow dry my hair (stupidly thinking it was possible to look somewhat glamorous during labour – I was wrong!!)\nBy the time I had my shower, the contractions were coming every 4 minutes, so I knew I needed to get to the hospital asap.\nWe arrived at the hospital at 11am, and I was brought straight into the emergency room to be examined. <<|needle|>>I immediately started on gas and air, as the pains were coming so quickly and I was not getting much of break in between. <<|needle|>>I was already 3cm dilated when the doctor examined me, so I was brought straight to the labour ward to meet my midwife.To be honest, I don’t remember entering the labour ward, as I was in a wheelchair and pretty high on the gas and air, so had my eyes closed trying to focus on getting through each pain.\nThe minute I met my midwife, I asked for an epidural, as I was struggling with the contractions. <<|needle|>>I had the epidural done, but unfortunately it didn’t work first time around. <<|needle|>>After an hour waiting on this epidural to kick in, the midwife called for another anaesthetist to put in a second epidural. <<|needle|>>At this stage I was totally fed up and the pains were becoming unbearable, but the minute the second epidural went in,I could feel the relief, and the contraction pains slowly started to ease off.\nAfter about an hour I was examined again, and was 10cm dilated, so I was ready to deliver. <<|needle|>>The midwife advised that I should wait an hour before pushing, to allow baby to naturally come down slightly, and to give myself a rest before I had to push. <<|needle|>>They agreed to start pushing at 5pm, but by 4.40pm, the epidural was wearing off and the pains were coming fast again, so I asked to start pushing.After a long hour and twenty minutes pushing, my not so little baby arrived. <<|needle|>>When he was placed on my chest, I couldn’t get over the size of him, but was in awe of how perfect he looked. <<|needle|>>His big eyes looking up at me, his golden hair and perfect pouty lips. <<|needle|>>I was instantly overwhelmed and cried my eyes out, in awe of him, and what I had just been through. <<|needle|>>Both myself and Paul just sat and stared at him, crying with happiness. <<|needle|>>From that moment, I realised my whole world had changed forever, and I was now this amazing little boy’s Mum.The past two weeks of have been the best weeks of my life. <<|needle|>>I cannot describe the feeling of love and admiration I have for my son, and how scary it is to love such a tiny little human being as much as I do. <<|needle|>>I already know I would give up my life for him, and will do everything in my power to make him the happiest boy on the planet. <<|needle|>>Myself and Paul have spent the past two weeks just staring at him, watching every move he makes.\nMotherhood has already been the most amazing experience of my life to date, and I am envious of any mum to be, who gets to experience everything for the first time. <<|needle|>>You are in for the most overwhelming feelings of love and content. <<|needle|>>I feel like I have changed so much as a person in a matter of days, and everything I do is now with my son’s best interests at heart.It is finally time to say goodbye to 2014. <<|needle|>>It will always remain the most magical year of my life, and I look forward to spending 2015 with my new little family.\n\nThank you to each and every one of you who has supported me this past year, and I look forward to an exciting and fun filled 2015 here on Hearts, Heels and Handbags (and Harry!)\n\nHappy New Year to you all,\n\nYou may also enjoy:Why snow shovelling can be DEADLY: Activity puts an unusual amount of strain on the heart, say

who died shovelling snow in Pennsylvania, as well as a U.S. <<|needle|>>Capitol Police officer who suffered a heart attack while shovelling snow at home.\n\nThree people in New York died while shovelling, as well as two from Maryland and another person in DC.\n\nHere, writing for The Conversation, Jack Goodman, professor and adjunct scientists at University of Toronto, explains why shovelling snow can be so dangerous - and what you should do to make it safer.Many people in the US are still shovelling snow after the massive blizzard that plowed through. <<|needle|>>Expert Jack Goodman of the University of Toronto explains why shovelling snow can be hazardous for your health\n\nParts of the northeastern United States are still digging out after a blizzard. <<|needle|>>And more snow is on the way.\n\nYou may have seen news stories that shoveling snow can raise the risk of heart attack, or heart problems, at least for some people.\n\nSnow shoveling is a unique form of exertion.\n\nIt can be vigorous and challenging to the cardiovascular system in general, and the heart in particular.\n\nWhen combined with the inherent environmental conditions of winter, snow shoveling during or after a blizzard may be the 'perfect storm' for a cardiac event in those with known or 'occult' (hidden) coronary disease.\n\nThe 'risk-paradox' of exercise is that while physical activity performed over the long term is known to be very healthy and significantly lowers the risk for heart disease and other chronic diseases, vigorous exercise acutely increases the immediate risk of a cardiac event above that expected at rest.\n\nDespite this, it is widely accepted that the benefits far outweigh the risks and should be encouraged.\n\nIn fact, the more physically active you are, the less the acute risk is.\n\nBeing in good shape can give you added cardio-protection.\n\nThe reason snow shoveling leads to increased risk of a cardiac event is rather simple.\n\nAt rest the oxygen supply to the heart is not challenged very much, but during exercise the heart’s oxygen demands increase dramatically.\n\nSnow shoveling is particularly demanding in this regard.\n\nWhen you are healthy, your body has the ability to increase oxygen supply as the demand increases.\n\nAs the heart beats faster and harder, the coronary vessels open up and supply the additional blood flow that is required to feed the heart’s increased demand.Shovelling can raise the risk of heart attack. <<|needle|>>That's because, at rest the oxygen supply to the heart is not challenged very much, but during exercise the heart’s oxygen demands increase dramatically\n\nHowever, when coronary disease is present, blockages in the coronary vessels can limit blood flow, leading to slowed and inadequate oxygen supply.\n\nWhen the heart muscle (the myocardium) does not get sufficient oxygen, it can rapidly fail because it is highly dependent on blood flow (oxygen) to generate normal contractions.\n\nIf the heart muscle becomes starved for oxygen, it also becomes vulnerable to abnormal electrical activity that can lead to dangerous arrhythmia’s (irregular heartbeats) or a heart attack.\n\nOther less common types of underlying cardiac disease, often undetected, may also make the heart vulnerable to arrhythmia’s during heavy exertion when oxygen supply is outstripped by demand and can lead to similar, catastrophic consequences.\n\nSO WHAT IS IT ABOUT SNOW SHOVELLING?\n\nVery few studies have examined the physiology of snow shoveling because it is technically difficult to do so.\n\nWe do know that the cardiovascular demands of snow shoveling are very high.\n\nHOW MANY CALORIES CAN YOU BURN SHOVELLING SNOW?\n\nSnow shovelling can be an 'extremely virogous' activity.\n\nIn fact, it 'rivals the damands' of exercising on a treadmill or bicycle.\n\nFurthermore, shovelling often exceeds up to 90 per cent of a person's maximal exercise tolerance.\n\nBut, the number of calories a person will burn by shovelling snow varies heavily.\n\nit depends on their weight, the amount of time they spend shoveling and their physical condition.\n\nSo how many calories would they burn?\n\nAccording to the calorie calculator from CalorieLab, a 175 pound person shovelling snow by hand would burn 99 calories after 15 minutes of shovelling.\n\nFurthermore, they'd burn 398 after one hour.\n\nThere are two aspects of snow shoveling that make it unusual for the heart compared to, for example, walking or jogging.\n\nFirst and obviously, it is typically performed in cold weather.\n\nCold air inhalation may cause a reflex constriction of blood vessels, including the coronary arteries.\n\nCold air may also increase the blood’s propensity for clotting.\n\nIf blood clots form and there is a tear in the inside of the artery, a blood clot could form a blockage.\n\nThe second issue is the nature of the exercise – and snow shoveling is unique.\n\nIt is typically done without a warm up, and includes considerable arm work that increases blood pressure drastically.\n\nAs blood pressure rises, so too does the work of the heart.\n\nMeanwhile, your leg muscles are typically performing isometric work (where you produce a lot of tension but your muscles don’t move your joint – like an even tie during an arm-wrestle).\n\nThis type of muscle activity, especially in the upper body (as you tightly grip the shovel), raises blood pressure more than, say, walking or jogging.In addition, you typically perform the Valsalva maneuver: a natural tendency to generate lots of chest pressure without exhaling breathing out (like tennis players do when they hit a ball, or when you push hard against something).\n\nIronically, the metabolic cost of snow shoveling (oxygen consumption for the whole body) may not be more than typical sub-maximal exercise like a light jog, but the oxygen cost to the heart is likely to be very high.\n\nFailing to warm up may add further demands on the heart.\n\nThe blood vessels going to the working skeletal muscles may not open up as quickly, so it takes more effort for the heart to pump blood.\n\nThe bottom line: the cardiac cost of snow shoveling is disproportionately high, is compounded by cold air inhalation which may increase the likelihood of blood clotting and coronary vessel constriction.\n\nThe nature of the exercise is challenging to the heart and is not likely to be accompanied by an adequate warm up.\n\nI also suspect that the cool down after this exercise is likely minimal if not non-existent.\n\nThrowing off the coat and sitting in a state of exhaustion certainly doesn’t count as a proper cool down.\n\nSNOW WILL KEEP COMING - WHAT CAN YOU DO?\n\nFor most people, snow shoveling is a safe form of exercise, even if it is a little difficult.\n\nBut you should get a green light from your doctor if you have been diagnosed with, or are considered to be at risk for, coronary heart disease.<image>Before shovelling snow, a person should spend up to 10 minutes warming up, as well as wearing a scarf around their mouth in very cold conditions. <<|needle|>>Furthermore, they should use a smaller shovel and take a few minutes to cool down after shovelling\n\nIf you are not accustomed to vigorous exercise, some caution is warranted.\n\nSnow shoveling can be vigorous exercise, so start the right way.\n\nWarm up gradually – at least 5-10 minutes. <<|needle|>>Consider wearing a scarf around the mouth in very cold conditions, as this will warm inhaled air.\n\nStart with small loads of snow and keep them manageable - especially when its wet and heavy.\n\nUse a smaller shovel so that your lifts are much, much smaller and can be managed for a long time without getting exhausted.\n\nBreathe throughout the entire process of gathering, lifting and throwing the snow – don’t hold your breath as you exert effort.\n\nAs you warm up, some greater effort can be considered, but easy does it.\n\nWhen you’ve won the battle, cool down – walk it off for a few minutes, perhaps inspecting the shoveling efforts of a few neighbors before going inside to a warm house.\n\nFor those of us living in colder parts of the world, that means there’s likely plenty more snow still to come.\n\nRemember that being physically fit lowers your risk from cardiac disease, and regular exercise is highly recommended for most individuals.\n\nThat being said, be cautious and get sound advice from your physician if in doubt.\n\nFor most people, regular exercise (including both aerobic and strength) will enhance your quality of life - and make your future shoveling much easier - and safer too.The REALITY is Arkansas taxes it people too much and spends too much.\n\n(These points shown later in the article.)\n\nThe FANTASY world of Governor Asa Hutchinson and his allies is …. <<|needle|>>you can base your budget on spending all you have and anytime you want more tax money you can yell “crisis” and increase the tax burden on Arkansans, and this patter can continue indefinitely.\n\nHutchinson got legislation passed to continue Obamacare Medicaid Expansion despite enrollment in the program growing beyond all projections. <<|needle|>>(The program primarily serves able bodied working age adults who don’t work.)\n\nThis year the Governor grew government by getting legislation passed for his environment agency to monitor tires through every stage – from new sale to final disposal.\n\nGovernor Hutchinson got tax increases passed earlier this year on new and used tires, soft drinks and soda, digital downloads, and unemployment benefits, but he is still pushing for two major tax increases. <<|needle|>> One is the internet sales tax on purchases from out of state sellers who have no presence in Arkansas. <<|needle|>> The other is an additional tax on gasoline and diesel fuel for road projects.\n\nThe Tax Reform and Relief Legislative Task Force created and led by the Governor’s nephew Senator Jim Hendren is looking not at how to reduce tax but at how to shift tax burdens among taxpayers. <<|needle|>> The task force’s consultant has presented reasons to impose an internet sales tax (which the Governor’s nephew voted for) and discussing where more tax money can be collected by eliminating tax exemptions. <<|needle|>>At one meeting the consultant was asked if there are any Arkansas taxes that can be raised because the rate is lower than in neighboring states. <<|needle|>>Clearly, this is not reform or relief.\n\nTheir fantasy world continues the path of bigger government and higher tax burdens while ignoring the reality that Arkansas is a high tax state and a high spending state, while Arkansas’ residents have a lower median income as compared to other states.\n\nAgain, to be fair there have been some tax cuts under Governor Hutchinson. <<|needle|>> But the tax cuts have been the same type of cuts the Democrats used while growing government. <<|needle|>> The Democrat plan was always to look at how much of new revenue collections they wanted for growing government and then take part of the remainder to use for a tax cut. <<|needle|>> In other words, a tax cut for show. <<|needle|>> Hutchinson also gave a tax break for military retirement pay by raising other taxes which gave the state additional money to grow government.\n\nTax and Spend – Comparing Arkansas to Other StatesThe tax burden per person in Arkansas is high when compared to other states. <<|needle|>> The Tax Foundation says Arkansas is the seventeenth highest state in the nation. <<|needle|>> Taxpayers in all six surrounding states pay less per person. <<|needle|>>The report is based on the 2014 fiscal year and appears in Facts & Figures 2017: How Does Your State Compare? It is Table 5 -State Revenue Per Capita.\n\nBelow is Arkansas’ high tax compared to the surrounding states.Arkansas did just as poorly when the Tax Foundation looked at the state-local tax burden per capita in Fiscal Year 2012.According to the Census Bureau only West Virginia and Mississippi have a lower median household income than Arkansas.We Can’t Afford to Stay on the Same Path\n\nThe picture is clear and has been clear for a very long time – Arkansas has a spending problem. <<|needle|>> Arkansas’ balanced budget is really a “spend everything you have” budget. <<|needle|>> Then when a “need” arises, instead of prioritizing spending to keep from raising taxes, the politicians claim they are “forced” to raise taxes.\n\nArkansas’ tax burden handicaps the state and makes Arkansas unattractive for businesses. <<|needle|>> Arkansas then resorts to incentives for businesses supported by bonds. <<|needle|>>Arkansas taxpayers then have to pay off those bonds and that too keeps our tax burden high. <<|needle|>>High taxes also keep many people from considering moving to our beautiful state.\n\nWe can’t afford politicians who pretend to be “for the people” by bragging on minor tax relief, while at the same time raising the overall tax burden and growing government far beyond what we can afford.\n\nElections and a Return to Reality\n\nArkansas experienced a Republican revolution and many new Republican officeholders went to Little Rock ready to rein in big government, but when they got to Little Rock they were thwarted by both Democrats and establishment Republican leaders who like the tax and spend environment.\n\nReturning to Democrat control is NOT an option – they invented tax and spend.\n\nKeeping Republicans who want to spend like Democrats is NOT an option.\n\nIf Arkansas is to get out of its mess of high taxes and high state spending, there are two steps that are a must:\n\nAnything less means more of the same.The SRAM X01 drivetrain carries on the tradition of SRAM’s championship-winning 1X™ philosophy—all the way down the mountain.\n\n\nThe setup is simpler. <<|needle|>>The drivetrain is lighter. <<|needle|>>And the shifting is fast and solid. <<|needle|>>Bottom line: X01 is the right one for any terrain, every time. <<|needle|>>RELENTLESS.\"The XX1 rear derailleur looks different from other gear changers, owing to its “straight parallelogram” design. <<|needle|>>Unlike most current derailleurs, which use a slanted parallelogram to follow an angled path and maintain a constant gap between upper pulley and cogs, this one moves only in a horizontal plane.\n\nTo maintain the proper chain gap, XX1's upper pulley is radically offset from the center of the pulley-cage pivot. <<|needle|>>As the rider shifts, the pulley cage rotates to take up the chain slack, causing the upper pulley to move vertically, keeping it close to the cogs. <<|needle|>>SRAM claims this design, 'is faster, reduces shift force, and eliminates ghost shifting.' \"The XX1 cassette is eleven speeds, with a 10-42 range. <<|needle|>>SRAM developed a new, patent-pending body they call XD to deal with the sizing issue between the 10 tooth cog and a standard hub's driver body. <<|needle|>>Chris Hilton (SRAM's external drivetrain product manager) said SRAM shortened a typical driver body, and moved the threads from inside to the outside, and further inboard.\n\nInstead of an outboard lock ring that tightens the cassette onto the driver body, the XD cassette has a threaded seeve inside the cassette that pulls it into place. <<|needle|>>Hilton says this design allows SRAM to buld the cassette as one piece with no loose cogs or lock rings. <<|needle|>>This means you won't need ANY tools to remove the cassette!While there's nothing new with XX1's crank arms the X0 carbon arms with a forged-aluminum spider is optimized for use with a single ring. <<|needle|>>Offered with either BB30 or GXP axles, and in both 156mm and 164mm Q-Factor. <<|needle|>>XX1 bottom brackets use ceramic bearings.\n\nIt's easy to swap rings, thanks to threads on the chainrings themselves, which means you don't have to worry about losing any nuts, should you choose to swap rings mid-ride. <<|needle|>>But, because the derailleur's performance is dependent on having the right length chain, adding or removing a few links may be necessary if you change to a ring that has more than a four tooth difference from what you're currently running. <<|needle|>>But, Hilton says that in most cases, moving up or down one ring size should not require altering chain length.Because XX1 is designed around a single ring, and doesn't need to shift, the chain can be more robust. <<|needle|>>The 11-speed specific chain is slightly narrower than SRAM's 10-speed chain, and requires an 11-speed power lock. <<|needle|>>SRAM says the chain features a proprietary finish on the inner links, which consists of a coating and polish that gives it a slick, hard finish to reduce wear between the plates. <<|needle|>>The chain has hollow pins and windowed links, and weighs about the same as a SRAM 1090r 10-speed chain.\n\nOther than the extra click, XX1 shifters are basically identical to X0 2x10 triggers. <<|needle|>>There is, however, a carbon pull lever, and carbon cover. <<|needle|>>Or, you can opt for a GripShift changer, also nearly identical to it's X0 cousin. <<|needle|>>The shifters come with Gore Ride-On cables.According to record-store owner Lee Rea, “If art imitates life, then the record shop should be an epicenter for local culture.”\n\nRea is co-owner, along with his mother and sister, of the mom-and-pop record shop Peaches Records on Magazine Street. <<|needle|>>Peaches, opened in 1975 by Rea’s father, is one of nine independently owned record stores in New Orleans participating in the 12th annual Record Store Day this Saturday.\n\nRecord Store Day is an international celebration of independent record stores, according to Rick Johnson, one of three people who work full-time organizing the day’s festivities.<image>Records sit on display at Peaches Records on Magazine Street. <<|needle|>>Peaches is one of nine independent record stores in New Orleans participating in Record Store Day 2019.(Photo by India Yarborough)\n\nRecord Store Day is held in mid-April each year. <<|needle|>>It began in 2008, with about 300 participating stores. <<|needle|>>This year, Johnson said, more than 1,300 stores in the United States and several hundred more across the globe will open their doors Saturday, April 13, for a day filled with music and special promotions.\n\n“In the beginning, we had to go out and ask stores if they wanted to be a part of it,” Johnson said. <<|needle|>>“We’d go up to a record store and say ‘Hey, do you want to be a part of Record Store Day?’ Most of the time, it doesn’t really cost anything… There are going to be great records that you can’t get if you’re not a part of it. <<|needle|>>They’re pretty much going to say yes, so every year it’s gotten bigger and bigger.”\n\nJohnson added that Record Store Day is now celebrated by record-loving communities on every continent except Antarctica. <<|needle|>>“It ends up being the world’s biggest single-day music event,” he said.\n\nAnd they all have special releases up their sleeves.\n\n“There are so many one-offer leases of awesome, awesome, awesome bands that are only available that day,” Rea said. <<|needle|>>“The goal for us is to have people engaging with the music.”\n\nHere’s an interactive map of participating store in New Orleans:\n\nPeaches will open an hour early Saturday for Record Store Day. <<|needle|>>Though Rea said the store is keeping their special sales “close to the vest,” they’ll have hundreds of limited edition, special release LPs.\n\nThe store is also partnering with neighboring bar Ms. <<|needle|>>Mae’s to serve free beer on site and with Hansen’s Sno-Bliz to offer free sweet treats to customers. <<|needle|>>That’s in addition to Peaches having DJs in store, auction items and more.“We also spend the most to get all the records, so it’s our biggest output and biggest input,” Epstein said.\n\n“And of course, the main attraction is all the records,” Epstein added.\n\nAccording to Johnson, participating stores sold about 750,000 records during Record Store Day 2018.\n\nSome stores, like The Mushroom on Broadway Street, are offering special discounts to encourage sales. <<|needle|>>Record Store Day will also kick off The Mushroom’s 50th anniversary week.\n\n“We are doing $4.20 off of all new CDs and LPs, and then we’re doing 42 percent off of all our used inventory,” said store owner Christopher Hummel.\n\nHummel said The Mushroom has participated in Record Store Day every year since it started:\n\n“I do remember being very enthusiastic when it was first proposed as a thing that was going to happen. <<|needle|>>Ten or eight years ago, there wasn’t as strong of a presence in music buying. <<|needle|>>It was just kind of in the period of people starting to like records again. <<|needle|>>There are more independent, small record stores in town now than there have been in the last 20 years.”“Record Store Day was kind of this very novel, unique interaction between these majors, these bands that we all idolize and us,” Rea said.\n\nAnd Johnson said that’s part of the point.\n\nRea said that in an industry where the only constant is change, Record Store Day was “a breath of fresh air.”\n\n“The days of people waiting overnight for their favorite release … those days aren’t here anymore,” Rea said. <<|needle|>>“Record Store Day brought that back.”Parents dropping their children off at school today faced major disruption after travellers forced the

king’s arbitrary rule and opposing any toleration towards Roman Catholics. <<|needle|>>In the 1630s he was beset with financial problems concerning his estate, but in 1640 he returned to Parliament, by now an ardent Puritan, and bitterly attacked the king’s illegal actions. <<|needle|>>When the civil war broke out in 1642, he quickly emerged as an able military commander and an inspiring leader. <<|needle|>>He played a major part in Parliament’s victory at Marston Moor in 1644, and having assisted in the making of the New Model Army, contributed greatly to the victory at Naseby a year later. <<|needle|>>By 1647, when the king, having been captured, sought Scottish help, Cromwell had become convinced that the king should be tried for treason. <<|needle|>>With the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Preston in 1648, and the king’s execution in January 1649, he emerged as the country’s leader. <<|needle|>>As a military commander he again showed his prowess, but, as we shall see (1651 CW), as a politician he was to fail in his attempt to establish a workable form of republican government.xxxxxOliver Cromwell was a descendant of Thomas Cromwell, one-time advisor to Henry VIII. <<|needle|>>Born of a noble family at Huntingdon, he was educated by an ardent Puritan named Thomas Beard before attending Cambridge University to study law. <<|needle|>>After about a year, however, he was obliged to leave following the unexpected death of his father in 1617. <<|needle|>>He then took over the running of the family's small estate and, at the same time, played an active part in local government. <<|needle|>>In 1628 he was chosen as one of the parliamentary representatives for Huntingdon, and quickly showed his fervent interest in political and religious reform. <<|needle|>>During his first session he strongly supported the Petition of Rights, then going through parliament - setting out grievances against the king's arbitrary rule - and he spoke out fiercely against any toleration of Roman Catholic practices within the Protestant church.\n\nxxxxxOver the next ten years his fortunes fluctuated. <<|needle|>>In 1631, beset with financial problems, he was obliged to sell most of his estate at Huntingdon, but five years later he was able to move to property inherited at Ely. <<|needle|>>By this time he had become fervently devoted to the Puritan cause, having emerged, as he put it, \"from darkness into light\". <<|needle|>>And in politics too he had become strongly opposed to the king's personal rule, the so-called Eleven Years' Tyranny. <<|needle|>>In this he was not alone. <<|needle|>>There were many disgruntled landowners up and down the country, including his cousin John Hampden, who had openly opposed the king over his levying of ship money. <<|needle|>>In 1640 Cromwell returned to the House of Commons, this time representing Cambridge. <<|needle|>>The dispute between crown and parliament was then at its height and he added his support to the Grand Remonstrance, a host of grievances against the king's illegal conduct.xxxxxWhen civil war eventually broke out in 1642 he quickly emerged as an able organizer and a remarkable leader of men. <<|needle|>>He devoted much of his time to raising a highly disciplined regiment of cavalry, and such was the efficiency of this force that he soon became recognized as an outstanding military commander. <<|needle|>>In 1644 he was made a lieutenant general under the earl of Manchester (whom he later openly accused of incompetence), and in July of that year played a vital role in the defeat of the Royalist forces at the crucial Battle of Marston Moor. <<|needle|>>It was on this battlefield that Cromwell's cavalry earned the respect of the royalist leader Prince Rupert, and were given the title of \"the Ironsides\" (illustrated). <<|needle|>>The following year he assisted Sir Thomas Fairfax in the training of the New Model Army and was appointed cavalry commander of the new force. <<|needle|>>Once again, he played a major role at the decisive Battle of Naseby. <<|needle|>>That Parliament won a resounding victory was due in no small part to the quality of his leadership during that engagement.\n\nxxxxxIn the tortuous negotiations between the victors which followed the capture of the king, Cromwell attempted to reconcile Army and Parliament, but there was little trust on either side. <<|needle|>>Then any hope of finding an acceptable settlement came to an abrupt end in November 1647 when the king made his escape from Hampton Court, took refuge in Carisbroke Castle, on the Isle of Wight, and renewed the war with the aid of the Scots. <<|needle|>>Cromwell was given command of the army and, after putting down an uprising in Wales, crushed the Scots at the Battle of Preston in August 1648. <<|needle|>>He was now convinced that the time for talking was over; the king should stand trial on a charge of treason. <<|needle|>>In the meantime the army took matters into their own hands by what came to be known as \"Pride's Purge\". <<|needle|>>An officer named Colonel Pride simply barred certain members from the House. <<|needle|>>The Long Parliament was thereby reduced and the \"Rump\" which was left contained only those members who were in favour of bringing the king to trial!\n\nxxxxxIn January 1649 the king was found guilty of treason and was executed at the end of that month. <<|needle|>>The reign of Charles I was over but, as we shall see (1651 CW), the civil war was not. <<|needle|>>For Oliver Cromwell there were more battles ahead. <<|needle|>>In these he was to win the day, but his success on the battlefield was to be in marked contrast to his performance in the political arena. <<|needle|>>Here he was to fail in his efforts to bring about the reforms required to establish a workable and acceptable form of republican government.xxxxxIncidentally, the well-known nursery rhyme Goosey, Goosey Gander refers directly to Cromwell's Roundheads. <<|needle|>>They were noted for their \"goose stepping march\", and throughout the war they searched the houses of all known Royalists and Catholic sympathizers looking for king's men in hiding. <<|needle|>>Any suspect who refused to become a puritan was thrown into jail.\n\nGoosey goosey gander, Whither shall I wander,\n\nUpstairs and downstairs, And in my lady's chamber.\n\nThere I met an old man, Who would not say his prayers,\n\nSo I took him by the left leg, And threw him down the stairs.<image>Largely flanked by disused or underused buildings, vacant land and parking lots, the Frankford Creek remains the last major open-air creek in the city without adjacent green space. <<|needle|>>The Lower Northeast District Plan draft, to be released on Monday, proposes replacing these with a greenway: part green storm water management infrastructure, part public park, and all trail, the Frankford Greenway will follow the creek from Wingohocking Street to the Delaware River. <<|needle|>>It will connect with Tacony Creek Trail, now under construction, in the end forming a 6.2 mile trail connection between Montgomery County and the Delaware River.\n\nConceived by various city agencies including the City Planning Commission, Parks and Recreation, the Redevelopment Authority, and the Water Department, the project will help fulfill the City’s pledge that 75 percent of Philadelphians will live within a ten minute walk of a park or recreation facility by 2025.\n\n“There is a need for linear and local green space in this area of the city, as determined by Green 2015 and the upcoming Philadelphia Trail Master Plan,” write Rob Armstrong of the Planning, Preservation and Property Management Division of the Department of Parks and Recreation and Jeannette Brugger of the Strategic Planning and Policy Division of the Planning Commission, in an e-mail. <<|needle|>>“In addition, there is a need to connect several trail amenities in the area, such as the Tacony Creek Trail, the East Coast Greenway, the soon-to-be-constructed Port Richmond Trail on North Delaware Avenue, and on-road bicycle facilities, which will be satisfied by the Frankford Creek Greenway.”\n\nThe Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission has given the city a grant for an initial feasibility study, to study engineering and potential for land acquisition. <<|needle|>>An request for proposals for firms to conduct the analysis will be issued by winter. <<|needle|>>The study is expected to take ten months; after that, the project timeline becomes indeterminate, depending on funding and land acquisition.The feasibility stage of the project has the support of District Councilwoman María Quiñones-Sánchez. <<|needle|>>Ian Litwin, Lower Northeast District Plan project manager, says realization of the greenway remains a “moving target,” dependent on funding and land that have yet to be acquired. <<|needle|>>“All the land along the creek is privately owned so the city will have to acquire the land, which will not be cheap,” explains Litwin.\n\nFor precisely this reason, assembling the greenway will begin on the Juniata Park (south) side of the creek, where the parcels are relatively large. <<|needle|>>On the Frankford side, the creek is lined by rowhouse-sized lots. <<|needle|>>(It should be noted that though most of the land adjacent to the creek is vacant, according to city officials, no property owner will be forcibly relocated, and for those who choose to relocate the cost of their property and relocation would be compensated by the city.)\n\nLitwin compares the current state of the Frankford Creek to the Los Angeles River: paved, underused, and lined with vacant land only urban explorers care to frequent. <<|needle|>>The main difference is that the LA River is a constant trickle, while the Frankford Creek oscillates with rainfall between trickling and overflowing, a bi-product of the combined sewer system. <<|needle|>>One of the largest outfalls in the sewer district is where the creek runs by the Juniata Golf Course. <<|needle|>>Hence the Water Department’s interest in the project: the riparian area surrounding the creek is ripe for soft storm water management infrastructure, such as rain gardens, depaving, and storm basins.One model for the project is Delaware waterfront itself, where a trail, pocket parks, and natural stream banks have been inserted as funding and land become available.\n\nThe hope is that conservation of the creek’s ecology will catalyze preservation of the historic building stock alongside it. <<|needle|>>While some of the old industrial buildings will necessarily be demolished due to their derelict condition, others may be saved by private developers who could see renewed value in their proximity to the greenway for live-work spaces (akin to Globe Dyeworks, located a mile from the creek) among other uses. <<|needle|>>Real estate reinvestment, in turn, could churn up economic development. <<|needle|>>In anticipation of this rising real estate interest, Litwin is applying for historic preservation status for several buildings along the creek, including Tremont Mills at Adams Avenue and Wingohocking Street.In addition to stormwater features, the greenway is also likely to include neighborhood connections, benches and trash receptacles, and other user amenities, according to Armstrong and Brugger.You may be aware that Aston Martin updated the Vanquish S coupé late last year at the Los Angeles Auto Show.Just like the coupé, the convertible version is powered by an uprated 5.9-liter V12 engine delivering 595 hp (603 PS) at 7,000 rpm and 630 Nm (465 lb-ft) at 5,500 rpm. <<|needle|>>The unit works with a revised eight-speed Touchtronic III transmission that is said to shift gears quicker than before. <<|needle|>>Other mechanical updates include the revised inlet manifolds allowing the engine to breathe more freely and the quad exhaust tailpipes.As for the styling, the Vanquish S Volante has the same aero-enhanced carbon fiber body kit from its coupé sibling. <<|needle|>>The devil is in the details, they say, and the carbon fiber twill splitter and diffuser clearly confirm that saying. <<|needle|>>Besides giving the car a more dramatic look, these two elements improve its high-speed stability. <<|needle|>>As for the stunning 20-inch 10-spoke Gloss Black Cast alloy wheels, they are unique to the Vanquish S.Inside, the Aston Martin Vanquish S Volante gets goodies such as Filograph quilt design options, Bang & Olufsen audio, and the AMi III Infotainment system with all-new satellite navigation. <<|needle|>>Aston Martin has yet to confirm performance specs, but the Volante shouldn't be too far off the coupé, which covers the 0 to 100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 3.5 seconds and tops out at 323 km/h (201 mph).\n\nThere's no official word on the model's launch venue yet, but our bets are on the Geneva Motor Show. <<|needle|>>So what's it gonna be, this or the Vanquish Zagato Volante?Frock Flicks is, by definition, for fans of historical costume dramas. <<|needle|>>So in the United States, we owe a huge debt to PBS for it’s long-running showcase for these series: Masterpiece Theatre, now known simply as Masterpiece. <<|needle|>>Since January 10, 1971, Masterpiece has been THE place on American television for high-quality drama and particularly for historical costume shows, often ones imported from the UK.\n\nToday, we have Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming or video on-demand services that let us watch movies and TV series from around the world any time we want. <<|needle|>>But back in the day, the only option was to watch TV live exactly when it was broadcast in the country that played it. <<|needle|>>In the U.S., until the 2000s, you could only watch those amazing British costume dramas on PBS thanks to Masterpiece Theatre (unless you bought the show on VHS tape or later DVD). <<|needle|>>Kids these days are so spoiled.\n\nThe first 22 seasons of Masterpiece were hosted by Alistair Cooke, who passed away in 2004. <<|needle|>>The original Masterpiece format with Cooke inspired many parodies, including Alistair Cookie on Sesame Street. <<|needle|>>In 2008, the show changed to simply “Masterpiece,” while also splitting the content into Mystery!, Contemporary, and Classic, the latter being where all the historical costume series live. <<|needle|>>The hosts have included Gillian Anderson and Laura Linney, although their segment has lessened to almost be invisible in recent years.\n\nDespite these changes and the impact of streaming video, Masterpiece continues to be a major force in TV viewing and especially for historical drama fans. <<|needle|>>After all, in 2011, PBS was where Downton Abbey first made a splash in the U.S. <<|needle|>>— repeating the same success that Upstairs, Downstairs had in 1974. <<|needle|>>Far from being just an importer of fine British drama, in recent years, PBS has created the Masterpiece Trust to help fund these costume productions. <<|needle|>>Masterpiece Theatre is one of the producers for series such as Downton, Wolf Hall and the new Poldark.\n\nSo let’s remember some of the big hits of Masterpiece Theatre over the years, approximately in order of when they aired in America, and give PBS the thanks it’s due!<image>THE best 16th-century costume drama ever produced, bar none. <<|needle|>>I will hear no disagreement on this, don’t even try. <<|needle|>>Go read my full review, and glory in the spectacular gowns reproducing portraits of QEI so precisely. <<|needle|>>Glenda Jackson is just perfect as the queen, and despite the stagey 1970s interiors, this production holds up quite well, so look for it on DVD or streaming.AKA, the original Downton Abbey. <<|needle|>>And also a mega-hit on both sides of the pond. <<|needle|>>This historical soap-opera told the tale of the upper-crust Bellamy family and their servants. <<|needle|>>They all live in a posh London townhouse, and the story follows them through from 1903, through World War I, and to 1930. <<|needle|>>Hmmm, familiar much?Robin Ellis didn’t need to take off his shirt to set ladies’ hearts afire as rakish Ross Poldark. <<|needle|>>This was not only a huge hit for Masterpiece Theatre, but on video, the series outsold every costume drama until the 1995 Pride and Prejudice came along.The original bitchy Roman saga, starring Derek Jacobi and a cast of thousands including Siân Phillips, Patrick Stewart, Brian Blessed, and even John Hurt as Caligula. <<|needle|>>Check this sample dialogue — Tiberius talking about his mother Livia: “They say a snake bit her once … and died.” It’s all that and more.Set in the 1940s and looking back on the end of the British rule in India, this sprawling 14-part miniseries was part of a 1980s obsession in Britain with their own colonial empire (see also: Ghandi, 1982, A Passage to India, 1984). <<|needle|>>While us Yanks may not get the cultural undertones, we can appreciate the history and costumes, as Kendra did in her full review.Hi-larious!

C’mon, Hilary Mantel, finish writing the last book so we can have series two soon.Making shirtless scything a thing and Aidan Turner every girl’s wet dream. <<|needle|>>Prepare yourselves for another Poldark, probably in 2016 or early 2017.The final season! Yes, it’s already aired in the UK, but even fans who’ve spoiled themselves with the plotline can eek out one more cry-fest with the Crawleys, thanks to PBS.\n\nThese are just the highlights — what’s your favorite historical costume drama that’s aired on Masterpiece?Last Thursday night the Boston Beer Company celebrated the upcoming release of the 2011 Infinium Ale by hosting a pre-release tasting at their brewery. <<|needle|>>This is the fourth event over the course of the previous week, and the second one I attended, and could’t have been more fun.\n\nI brought my buddy, and occasional Guest Blogger Mike Micalone, as well as my buddy Mike Talley along with me, and from the moment we walked in I knew we were going to have a great time.Mike Talley next to a 134 bbl wooden fermenter\n\nThere was a special pre-gala portion of the event set aside for media personnel, such as bloggers, as well as the spot local celebrity, which was held inside the Barrel Room Collection room within the brewery itself. <<|needle|>>Meg, one of the reps Mike Micalone and I have run into at the AHA Rally, MA BrewersFest, and Beer Summit/Sam Adams Octoberfest, guided us to the room, where we saw some familiar faces. <<|needle|>>Brian Aldrich from Sea Coast Beverage Lab, Sean from 2Beerguys.com, Becca, Lindsay, and Heather from MA Girls Pint Out were all inside enjoying the Infinium and light spread that was laid out.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes of socializing, Jim Koch came into the room to everyone’s delight. <<|needle|>>He right away came up to myself, Mike Talley, Brian, and Sean, introduced himself, and asked for feedback on this year’s Infinium. <<|needle|>>He was genuinely interested in finding out our thoughts on it, which I thought was incredible, considering whom he is.<image>Jim then gave a brief speech, giving the 30 some odd people in the room an idea of how they came about collaborating with Weihenstephan on the beer (which was quite amusing), the process of making the beer itself, and the specific purpose behind the particular style of beer that Infinium has developed into. <<|needle|>>After his chat on the beer, he then introduced three of the Boston area’s finest mixologists, who had each concocted “beer-cocktails” specifically using the 2011 Infinium Ale.All three of these gentlemen spoke as passionate about their beer cocktails as Jim Koch himself spoke about his Infinium Ale. <<|needle|>>It was really cool to see how psyched Ran, Adam, and Bob were about mixing these drinks for us, and they were all some really interesting drinks for sure. <<|needle|>>They're not the typical drink I would go for, but it was a great opportunity to try something new.\nAfter everyone gave their speeches, the rest of us continued to mingle, take pictures, and meet some new people. <<|needle|>>There were some folks from Yankee Brew News, as well as Brewing News, which all have a vast knowledge of the regional breweries and brews, which was nice to chat back and forth of where we had each been as well as spots I need to check out. <<|needle|>>As it turns out, and I knew to a certain extent, that there are many places in Vermont that I must visit in the next year or two.\n\nDan Hausle of WHDH TV, Channel 7 in Boston made an appearance as well, sans camera crew. <<|needle|>>I introduced myself and managed to chat with him for a good 10-15 minutes. <<|needle|>>As it turns out, Dan is a craft beer lover, and according to his profile on the WHDH website he's also a homebrewer (I wish I knew that last night). <<|needle|>>It turns out he's from Buffalo, NY as well, so it provided a good opportunity to talk sports as well (and make fun of him for his teams performing rather poorly at times).\n\nAfter hanging out in the Barrel Room for a while, we headed into the brewery and other tasting rooms to get a few more samples of some of the other fine offerings by Samuel Adams. <<|needle|>>While in the tasting room the Mikes and I met Chris, a military veteran who currently works as the building manager at the Boston Beer Company's corporate headquarters, who happened to be helping out pouring drinks. <<|needle|>>We shared a few funny stories about trips to Cooperstown, NY and where to find Old Fezziwig on tap - we're still waiting to see where in the Boston area you can find it (I've never seen it on tap). <<|needle|>>Once we find out, we'll make sure to share with you!\n\nOverall, it was a great evening. <<|needle|>>Jess, Meg, Chris, and Jim all made this night a really enjoyable experience that I hope to partake in again sometime soon.\n\nInfinium Ale will officially be released next week, and should retail for around $20. <<|needle|>>Last year I managed to try a few bottles, and really enjoyed it. <<|needle|>>This years is equally as good, if not better than last year's release, and is definitely a bottle you can enjoy with friends.\n\nPosted by BrewEngland at 1:30 PM\n\nGreat event all around. <<|needle|>>I look forward to getting some more Infinium and hitting next year's release!\n\nIt's funny that you brought 2 Mike's with ya. <<|needle|>>Maybe bext time you can bring a couple of \"Joes\" or \"Jims\".\n\nThanks Sean. <<|needle|>>Bringing two Mikes made it easy for me to remember Brian's buddy's name, not to mention Mike from Yankee Brew News. <<|needle|>>I'll work on the Joes or Jims, but I can definitely get two Sarahs.Google Just Got Really Bad News. <<|needle|>>Here's Why It'll Probably Get Worse, and What It Means for You. <<|needle|>>It seems like it was only a matter

global power, it cannot shy away from the humanitarian responsibility.On March 31, 2021, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) issued a statement calling all countries neighbouring Myanmar to offer refuge and protection to all those fleeing the country for their safety. <<|needle|>>This came in response to the escalation in violence towards protestors in Myanmar since the coup led by the Myanmar military overthrew the democratically elected government.\n\nSince the coup, the country has been witnessing extreme violence and indiscriminate use of force against peaceful protestors, arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances. <<|needle|>>Apart from this, the military government has also made different amendments to the country’s legal provisions which have been called out by various human rights agencies as being arbitrary and interfering with basic human rights each individual is guaranteed under international law.\n\nIndia was quick to issue a statement expressing concern over the situation in Myanmar. <<|needle|>>With the socio-political situation worsening, as many as 700 persons have crossed over to India from Myanmar particularly into the state of Mizoram which shares its borders with Myanmar.<image>In response to this anticipated influx, a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was compiled by the Mizoram government on “the facilitation of refugees and migrants from Myanmar”. <<|needle|>>This was followed by the Union home ministry issuing instructions to the four north-eastern states of Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh to “take appropriate action as per law” and “maintain a strict vigil at the border” to prevent an influx of people from Myanmar. <<|needle|>>In the same instructions, the states were also reminded that they didn’t have the authority to declare anyone as “refugees” as India is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention.\n\nThe state of Mizoram, however, expressed its concerns over this course of action and the chief minister of the state even went on to say that  “the people of his state, who share ethnic ties with the refugees from Chin communities, can’t remain indifferent to their plight” and that they “couldn’t ignore this humanitarian crisis”.\n\nAlthough laid down formally under the 1951 Refugee Convention, the principle today has been implicitly understood to be part of customary international law to be followed by states despite not signing or acceding to any convention or treaty.\n\nAdditionally, India is a signatory of the UN Convention Against Torture (UNCAT) which contains a clear provision against return or extradition of a person “to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture” (Article 3).\n\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which India has ratified, also contains the provision on the “right to be free from torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” (Article 7), which has been interpreted by the Human Rights Committee in its General Comment No.20 to include protection against refoulement. <<|needle|>>While international law stands clear on non-refoulement, Indian courts have also not shied away from interpreting non-refoulement to be very much part of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution (as reflected in the cases of Ktaer Abbas Habib Al Qutaifi v. <<|needle|>>Union of India (1998) and Dongh Lian Kham v. <<|needle|>>Union of India(2015)).\n\nOver the past few decades, numerous refugees from Myanmar have found respite within the borders of India, many of whom are registered with the UNHCR. <<|needle|>>Interestingly, in 1988 during the pro-democracy movement, India was more than welcoming to those fleeing into the country from then Burma, and even opened refugee camps for student activists in Mizoram and Manipur.\n\nThis does make one wonder why India has since taken such a strict stance when it comes to refugees from Myanmar, particularly now when the country is facing another major humanitarian crisis and those fleeing are of utmost need for protection.One of the reasons we could allude to is the lack of a refugee policy or law laid down in India. <<|needle|>>The legal status of any “foreigner” in the country is governed by two critical pieces of legislation, the Foreigners Act 1946 and Passports (Entry into India) Act 1920 and the rules issued subsequently under these acts.\n\nWhile much progress has been made, in courtrooms, the safety and security of a refugee in the country still remain precarious with no clear law and policy, leaving them to search for space to survive between judicial interpretation and ad-hoc policy changes.\n\nAt the centre of this are persons from the Rohingya community who have been described as the “most persecuted minority” by the United Nations given the atrocities faced by them in Myanmar. <<|needle|>>Early last year, in a landmark move, the International Court of Justice also ordered Myanmar to prevent genocidal acts against the Rohingya Muslims shedding light on the extreme situation faced by the stateless minority in the country.\n\nWhile people from the Rohingya community have been fleeing Myanmar for a few years, the 2017 exodus was perhaps the biggest wave of displacement. <<|needle|>>Around the same time, in 2017, the ministry of home affairs issued an advisory to “identify”, “monitor” and “initiate deportation proceedings against all illegal immigrants from Rakhine state, also known as Rohingyas”.\n\nThe order has been challenged in the Supreme Court of India and was condemned by human rights organisations both within India and outside. <<|needle|>>While the adjudication on this matter remains pending, arrests and detention of Rohingya persons have continued leading up to the recent events of the past month.\n\nOver the past month, multiple reports have surfaced of arrests and detention of close to 300 Rohingya persons across the country. <<|needle|>>At least 160 have been detained from Jammu where, following a biometric verification organised by the local administration, some Rohingya never returned to the camps and were later found to be incarcerated.\n\nMeanwhile, arrests have also taken place in Delhi, even from outside the premises of the office of UNHCR in the capital. <<|needle|>> In an urgent plea before the Supreme Court challenging the arrests in Jammu, the court, without staying the deportations per se, ordered that those who have been arrested should not be deported unless the procedure prescribed for such deportation is followed.\n\nOver the years, while there have been successful attempts by human rights lawyers and the UNHCR to push for the release of refugees in detention, especially for those recognised by UNHCR, there have been some conflicting judgments from the courts in this regard. <<|needle|>>Additionally, when it comes to deportation, the challenge seems much harder, albeit it being in defiance of the principle of non-refoulement.People belonging to the Rohingya Muslim community sit outside their makeshift houses on the outskirts of Jammu May 5, 2017. <<|needle|>>Photo: Reuters/Mukesh Gupta/Files\n\nOver the past month, whether it be the sealing of borders and strict vigil against those coming in from Myanmar or the arrests and detention of Rohingya living in the country, both events equally point towards the need for much more legal stability and predictability when it comes to the protection of those fleeing into the country fearing persecution.\n\nPerhaps best described in the words of refugee law expert, B.S. <<|needle|>>Chimini, India’s asylum and refugee policy is nothing short of a “strategic ambiguity”. <<|needle|>>It seems to be a policy which on the one hand embodies the principle of ‘Vasudeva Kutumbakam’ and welcomed Tibetan refugees and Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka, providing them with shelter and support but seems to be averse to the prospect of safety and security of those fleeing from other countries, like the Rohingya from Myanmar.\n\nChimini argues for clear legislation on refugees, pointing towards the need for a rights-based approach rather than a charity-based approach. <<|needle|>>Legislation, he argues, would allow the country to prevent refoulement and arbitrary detention of refugees. <<|needle|>>Additionally, a clear law with clear definitions of a ‘migrant’ and a ‘refugee’ will also help identify actual ‘illegal immigrants’, ensuring the security and safety of the country without breaching international law.\n\nAn unambiguous policy would also help establish a stronger relationship with the UNHCR in the country. <<|needle|>>Like many countries, India could take advantage of the expertise of the UNHCR with regards to Refugee Status Determination and collaboratively work on the socio-economic protection of refugees, thereby reducing the financial and administrative burden on the state’s exchequers. <<|needle|>>National law may also cover refugees from South Asia, who are currently outside the ambit of the UNHCR in India.\n\nWhile the push for accession to the 1951 Refugee Convention is a critical ask in the eyes of International Refugee Law, it is without denial a very far ask. <<|needle|>>However, in the short term, the need is for clarity and due process – which is only possible with a clear refugee policy.\n\nArguments supporting the maintenance of the status quo for geopolitical or nationalistic reasons fall short in the face of the humanitarian crisis Myanmar faces today. <<|needle|>>When the world is grappling with a global pandemic that has only pushed the marginalised further into poverty, the humanitarian agenda is the only agenda that secures a seat at the table.\n\nDevika Nair is the founder and director at NyāyaSarathy Foundation, an organisation working towards increasing access to justice for marginalised communities.

https://spiritreports.blogspot.com/search?q=IEVA+KHIRKOV+OF+QUEBEC+CITY+CANADAContraceptives: As the Lord and I continued our journey through Hell, this is what happened. <<|needle|>>We came near a hooded demon with a black cloak. <<|needle|>>His presence was so evil; he had a book in his hand and a bone pen. <<|needle|>>This book was the book of hell and was written on its cover, book of eternal death.\n\nThey were being deceived. <<|needle|>>I could not reveal names so as not to cause scandals in the country. <<|needle|>>The Lord did not allow. <<|needle|>>The Lord Jesus commanded that demon to open the book and show my name. <<|needle|>>To my surprise my name was there I cried and said, \"Lord, why have I dedicated my life to you, and yet I shall be cast into hell?\"The United States government had launched a campaign where couples were to have a son, at most two. <<|needle|>>This program was called birth control. <<|needle|>>I had avoided children, but only later did I realize that it was a plot of Satan behind the government.\n\nThe Lord said, \"After you and your husband left for the United States, you listened to demons and took birth control contraception and killed a life that would form in your womb. <<|needle|>>I would raise that child as a prophet on earth and you have taken this medicine that was designed here in hell to kill My children.\n\nNo murderer will inherit My kingdom, all the women who sacrifice their children to the demon Molech are not worthy of My kingdom. <<|needle|>>The mothers of My maids are holy; they cannot take diabolical

part of hell. <<|needle|>>I saw a horrible demon. <<|needle|>>That demon was preparing a substance in hell. <<|needle|>>The Lord Jesus said, \"This substance is Moloch's poison, which is produced here and goes to the pharmacies in the form of contraceptives.\" I could perceive the deceit of Satan.\n\nThe Lord did not want to condemn me to hell but to give me a chance to arrange my life.

<<|needle|>>The observed value of coercive field (Hc) and the remanent magnetization (Mr) for the compound are 0.32 KOe and 0.36 . <<|needle|>>According to study of zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization curves and AC magnetization curves, there exists a spin-glass behaviour in the compound, which exhibits freezing temperature  K, below magnetic transition  K; that glass behavior is termed “reentrant” spin glass.\n\nNiCl2·6H2O, Mn(SO4)2·6H2O, and K3Fe(CN)6 are of reagent grade and without further purification. <<|needle|>>Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed on Perkin-Elmer 2400 II analyser. <<|needle|>>IR spectrum was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR spectrophotometer as KBr pellet in the 4000~400 cm−1 range. <<|needle|>>Magnetization measurements were measured by a Quantum Design MPMS-7S superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in the scope of 2–300 K.\n\nIR spectrum of the compound has been recorded over the 400–4000 cm−1 range shown in Figure 2. <<|needle|>>It shows two obvious bands at 2075.01 and 2151.74 cm−1 indicating the existence of two types of cyanide groups in the crystal lattice of compound [7–9]. <<|needle|>>Compounds with CN− functional group are easily identified by their stretching frequencies in 2200–2000 cm−1 range, which are consistent with the formation of bridging cyanide groups, and there are two different coordination environments. <<|needle|>>Moreover, the broad peaks at 3432.90 cm−1 and 1615.02 cm−1 are assigned to the v (O–H) of the crystal water stretching vibrations.Figure 2\nFT-IR spectrum of the compound.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of the compound was measured from 2 K to 300 K in 250 Oe field. <<|needle|>>Figure 3 shows the field-cooled magnetization versus temperature curve and a sharp increase in is observed around 21 K. <<|needle|>>Magnetic transition temperature was estimated from minima of versus curve, which corresponds to the steepest increase of magnetization with decreasing temperature (as shown in Figure 4). <<|needle|>>The phase transition the compound undergoes from a paramagnetic to ferro/ferrimagnetic type is about 8.5 K, which is lower than that for the parent compound Ni1.5[Fe(CN)6]·xH2O ( K) [10].<image>Figure 3\nversus for the compound.Figure 4\nversus for the compound.\n\nThe inverse susceptibility as a function of temperature in the paramagnetic state is shown in Figure 5. <<|needle|>>The curve rises slowly with decrease of temperature from 300 to 25 K and then rises sharply as temperature continues to decrease. <<|needle|>>The shows a sharp maximum at 2 K. <<|needle|>>This kind of behaviour is a characteristic of a ferromagnet. <<|needle|>>The magnetic order results from the combination of ferromagnetic and neighboring antiferromagnetic interactions. <<|needle|>>Furthermore, high temperature DC susceptibility is found to obey the Curie-Weiss law.Figure 5\nversus for the compound.Figure 6\nversus for the compound.\n\nA curve of versus is shown in Figure 7, and the value at room temperature is 5.7 cm3·K·mol−1. <<|needle|>>Upon lowering the temperature, value sharply increases after 15 K with a further decrease of the temperature. <<|needle|>>The shows a sharp maximum value of 35.3 cm3·K·mol−1 at 9 K and then finally decreases more rapidly on further cooling. <<|needle|>>For a ferromagnetic compound, versus curve reaches a minimum before rising around magnetic ordering temperature [12–14].Figure 7\nversus for the compound.\n\nA curve of versus is shown in Figure 8. <<|needle|>>The effective moment first slowly decreases to reach a minimum of 6.47 at 23 K and then sharply increases to reach maximum of 16.83 at 9 K and final decrease at lower temperature, indicating antiferromagnetic interaction between paramagnetic centers [15–17]. <<|needle|>>Magnetic transition temperature was estimated from minimum of versus curve, which corresponds to the steepest increase of magnetization with decreasing temperature (as shown in Figure 6; insert: plot of versus ). <<|needle|>>The compound undergoes a paramagnetic to ferro/ferrimagnetic type phase transition at 9.5 K, which could be attributed to an intermolecular antiferromagnetic interaction and/or a zero-field splitting (ZFS) effect. <<|needle|>>This kind of behaviour is a characteristic of a ferromagnet [18, 19].Figure 8\nversus for the compound (insert: plot of versus ).\n\nFigure 9 shows the curves of zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization of the compound at different field , 100, 250, and 500 Oe. <<|needle|>>The values of increase and exhibit weak irreversibility in the field-cooled (FC) magnetization curves below  K. <<|needle|>>There is a clear bifurcation phenomenon of the field-cooled () and zero-field-cooled () magnetization curves. <<|needle|>>is a bifurcation temperature point of which FC and ZFC magnetization curves separate out. <<|needle|>>In addition, the behavior that exhibits a maximum below is attributed to the cooperative freezing of spin glass (as shown in Figure 10). <<|needle|>>The irreversible behavior of and shift of bifurcation point to lower temperature with increasing are characteristic for spin glasses [10, 11]. <<|needle|>>It may be reasonable that these metal ions , , and through cyanide-bridged ligand have the coexistence of different valence states or spin states, the presence of inhomogeneity, and inherent structural disorder, which propagate possibly the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction via bridging cyanide, and there exist a structural disorder and a certain content of crystallization water which lead to the weak spin-orbit coupling. <<|needle|>>The spin-glass property is due to magnetic domain kinetics under different cooling conditions and the presence of available vacant sites in the lattice for the water molecules.Figure 10\nand versus for the compound.\n\nIt was also confirmed that there exists a spin-glass behavior in the compound through AC magnetization curves. <<|needle|>>The AC magnetic susceptibility of the compound was measured at 4 Oe AC amplitude with zero-applied DC field when varying the frequencies () from 10 to 1000 Hz, as shown in Figure 11. <<|needle|>>The temperature dependence of zero-static field AC magnetic susceptibilities shows that the in-phase component () has a maximum at about 7.7 K for frequencies of 10, 32, 100, 320, and 997 Hz and that a significant out-of-phase component () appears, confirming the long-range ferromagnetic ordering. <<|needle|>>On decreasing temperature, the in-phase signals increase abruptly at around 12 K, reach the maximum at about 7.7 K, and then decrease slowly. <<|needle|>>The out-of-phase signals increase steadily to the maximum around 8 K and then decrease slowly, as shown in Figure 11. <<|needle|>>The fact that the () clearly shows a frequency dependence is typically assigned to spin glasses [12, 13]. <<|needle|>>The freezing temperature (),  K, is defined by the maximum in the plot at low frequency. <<|needle|>>It undergoes a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at around 7.7 K. <<|needle|>>In fact, the temperature value of the maximum of χ at a given frequency () corresponds to the blocking temperature (), whereby it is assumed that the switching of the oscillating AC field matches the relaxation rate of the magnetization.<image>Figure 11\nand curves of AC magnetic susceptibility of the compound with different frequencies.\n\nProportional relationship between freezing temperature and logarithm of frequency in spin-glass system can be described by quantifying the frequency dependence through the ratio , which can be written as . <<|needle|>>versus is shown in Figure 12. <<|needle|>>The value of freezing temperature of zero frequency is  K by extrapolation method and the value of obtained for the compound is 0.0011, which fall within the range typical for the conventional spin-glass system (10−2-10−3). <<|needle|>>Surprisingly, both the in-phase and out-of-phase signals ( and ) go through a maximum with strong frequency dependence. <<|needle|>>Both in the real and in the imaginary components the peaks shift to lower temperatures with decreasing frequencies. <<|needle|>>However, the intensities of the peaks behave differently. <<|needle|>>While the intensity of the peaks for the real component increases with decreasing frequencies, in the imaginary component the intensity of the peaks decreases with decreasing frequencies. <<|needle|>>This behaviour of and is typical of a spin-glass state [16–19].Figure 12\nThe dependence of the .\n\nIn order to further understand the nature of magnetic ordering, the ferromagnetism behavior is characterized by the measurements of field-dependent magnetization, as shown in Figures 11 and 13. <<|needle|>>The observed value is 3.85 at 50 kOe, but the compound does not reach full saturation and this behavior is likely to be related to the spin-glass behavior as well as the amount of spin and type of coupling in the compounds Ni1.5[Fe(CN)6]·xH2O [18] and Mn3[Fe(CN)6]2·15H2O [10].Figure 14\nThe hysteresis loop for the compound.\n\nTherefore, synthesis ideas of molecular alloy magnet can be regarded as a synthesis method to expand a new type of magnetic functional materials, whose magnetic properties can be tuned and controlled by changing the composition of different transition metal cations [15, 17–19].\n\nWe have reported a detailed investigation of magnetic properties of multimetallic Prussian blue compounds Ni0.25Mn1.25[Fe(CN)6]·6.1H2O. <<|needle|>>The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities show the magnetism transition for the compound at 8.5 K. <<|needle|>>The Curie constant ( cm3·K·mol−1) and the Curie-Weiss temperature ( K) are obtained through a linear fitting of at the linear region [8–10].\n\nThe observed values of coercive field () and remanent magnetization () for the compound are 0.32 KOe and 0.36 . <<|needle|>>Moreover, there exists a spin-glass behaviour in the compound according to study of zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization curves and AC magnetization curves, which exhibits freezing temperature , below magnetic transition  K. <<|needle|>>Such a glass behavior is termed “reentrant” spin glass. <<|needle|>>It was also confirmed by the behaviour of and , which go through a maximum with strong frequency dependence.\n\nThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science

and a windshield made of air\n\nNew York (CNN Business)-The new McLaren Elva supercar costs $1.7 million, not including options like a sound system or exposed carbon fiber body panels. <<|needle|>>One option you won’t be able to get: A roof.\n\nThe Elva isn’t a convertible. <<|needle|>>It’s an open-topped roadster, meaning it has, literally, zero roof of any kind.\n\nYou can pay a little extra to get a windshield if you want. <<|needle|>>(It will be legally required to get one in some US states, McLaren said.)\n\nTo help keep the wind out of your face, the Elva’s Active Air Management System deploys when the car is driven at faster than suburban street speeds, roughly 25 miles per hour. <<|needle|>>The system directs air around the cabin to create what it calls a “bubble of calm” for those inside. <<|needle|>>Air is channeled through the car’s nose — or front end — and sent out in a high-velocity sheet, just ahead of the cockpit. <<|needle|>>This air acts like a windshield, forcing oncoming air around the cockpit. <<|needle|>>A small carbon fiber wind deflector also rises up at the front of the car, further directing the air around the cabin.The Elva, powered by an 804-horsepower turbocharged V8 engine mounted just behind the seats, can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in under three seconds. <<|needle|>>It’s part of McLaren’s Ultimate Series family of supercars, along with the track-focused Senna and the more road-oriented McLaren Speedtail, a three-seater with a center driver’s seat.Only 399 Elvas will be made, McLaren said, with the first expected to be delivered near the end of 2020. <<|needle|>>The British company also offers somewhat more accessible sports cars. <<|needle|>>For instance, prices for the McLaren 570S start at under $200,000 and the McLaren GT can be purchased for about $20,000 more than that.The Elva is modeled on the McLaren-Elva racecar of the mid-1960s. <<|needle|>>That car was originally created by McLaren but, after some initial racing success with early models, manufacturing was taken over by Elva Cars Ltd. <<|needle|>>In 1966 Road & Track magazine called the McLaren-Elva “the fastest car we’ve ever tested (and) an example of the latest thinking in sports/racing cars.”\n\nThat same year, Elvis Presley drove one in the musical racing movie “Spinout.” Like the latest version, the McLaren-Elva was an open-topped car. <<|needle|>>It was powered by a 340 horsepower Oldsmobile V8 engine that was also mounted behind the seats.Sadiq Khan 'should be ashamed' of criticism of Donald Trump\n\nRudy Giuliani, the US president's lawyer, has accused the Mayor of London of \"not paying attention to his job\".\n\nDonald Trump's lawyer says Sadiq Khan should be \"ashamed of himself\" for criticising the US president.\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, advised the Mayor of London to focus on leading the capital rather than making comments about Mr Trump.\n\nHe said: \"The Mayor of London is rallying against the president of the United States? He should be ashamed of himself. <<|needle|>>Maybe he should do his job rather than attack a world leader.\"\n\nMr Giuliani made the comments on the sidelines of a conference which called for regime change in Iran.\n\nMr Trump and Mr Khan have clashed repeatedly since the pair were elected around two years ago.\n\nMr Trump tweeted at the time: \"At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'\"His comment appeared to refer to an earlier statement by Mr Khan that: \"Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. <<|needle|>>There's no reason to be alarmed.\"\n\nMr Khan's spokesperson replied to the barb by saying the mayor \"has more important things to do\" than respond to an \"ill-informed tweet\" that deliberately took his comments out of context.\n\nAsked about Mr Khan's continued criticism of the president, Mr Giuliani said: \"Many of the people who go to London are American citizens. <<|needle|>>Half of us at least - or more, this president is more popular than ever - support the president. <<|needle|>>Even more people support (the office of) 'the president'.\"<image>\"I think it's highly inappropriate and he is probably suffering from some of the criticisms that Trump has made of him, which are valid.\n\n\"Now if crime's gone up, he's not paying attention to his job. <<|needle|>>This is one mayor who's telling him how to reduce crime but you have to pay attention to the job to do that.\"\n\nMr Trump is expected to make his first visit to the UK as president in July. <<|needle|>>It will be be a low-key working trip, rather than a state visit.Mr Khan recently has said he would \"be more than happy to meet with President Trump\", despite what he has said about \"diversity, about those who follow my faith, [and] about London\", in order to show him London's spirit.\n\nMr Trump was due to open the new US embassy in London in February, but cancelled the trip, saying the building was too expensive and tweeting that he was not a \"big fan\" of the decision to move its location.\n\nThe prospect of Mr Trump visiting the UK has seen backlash and the promise of protests and rallies from some of the British public.\n\nPreviously, more than 1.8 million Britons signed a petition demanding that the president be prevented from making a state visit to the UK.Bell, Ord and Wilkes called up for GB in under 23 Europeans eights\n\nThree athletes from Scotland have been selected to compete for Great Britain at the inaugural European U23 Rowing Championships in Poland this weekend.\n\nFiona Bell (Kilmacolm/Aberdeen Uni), Oliver Wilkes (Matlock/Edinburgh Uni) and Graham Ord (Hamilton/Edinburgh Uni) will compete in the team’s respective eights in the final under 23 competition of the season (2-3 September) at Kruszwica.\n\nGB won five medals in the World Rowing under 23 Championships at Plovdiv, including bronze for the men’s eight. <<|needle|>>Silver medallist from the coxed four, Oliver Wilkes, is in the middle of the eight this weekend, whilst Graham Ord, who finished ninth in the pair at the 2016 under 23 Worlds, takes the two seat.\n\n“It’s a development boat with some guys that went to Worlds and others that didn’t quite make the team,” said Wilkes, who has been training with the team at Caversham for the past three weeks.\n\n“I think we can go faster than people maybe think we should. <<|needle|>>We’ve got a bunch of exciting guys so I’m looking forward to seeing what we can do out there.”\n\nFrom Matlock in England, Edinburgh University Boat Club member and former swimmer, Wilkes has been one of the season’s revelations having been selected for the GB team at the first time of trying. <<|needle|>>Winning a medal in Plovdiv was beyond his wildest dreams.“I was ecstatic with my Worlds medal because obviously I’ve switched over from swimming to rowing and this was confirmation for me that I’ve made that move,” explained the high achieving Wilkes who describes his rowing abilities as ‘agricultural’ when he arrived at Edinburgh last autumn to begin an Msc in Sustainable Energy Systems.\n\n“I came to Edinburgh as a rough and ready rower but Colin Williamson gives us great coaching and we’ve got great facilities.\n\n“There’s the combination of coaching and just getting to row with much better athletes. <<|needle|>>The crew mates you get at Edinburgh are already good at rowing and it’s about learning off them and feeding off their experience.\n\n“I would still describe myself as a bit rough and ready, definitely not the finished article yet, and there’s a lot of work to be done.”\n\nFormer Edinburgh student, Hamilton’s Graham Ord, had been the nearly man this season having progressed most of the way through the GB trials. <<|needle|>>But he found his form through the summer, reaching the final of the Britannia Challenge Cup at Henley before success at the Home International Regatta where he won gold in the men’s coxless four.“This will be the biggest event I’ll go to this year, so it’s the pinnacle of the season right at the end of the year,” said Ord, who is in his final year of under 23 competition.\n\n“It’s a development boat in terms of people they want to develop for bigger things in the future.\n\n“They’re sending good people who they want to be even better in the future and maybe even pushing the senior team after under 23s.\n\n“This will hopefully be a bit of a stepping stone for me.”\n\nBritain’s women’s eight contains six rowers who competed in Plovdiv. <<|needle|>>Aberdeen’s Fiona Bell and her pairs partner, Isobel Powell, are the only two members of the Plovdiv eight to travel to Poland.“This season has been a bit of a whirlwind but I’ve come on leaps and bounds,” said Bell.\n\n“I have to admit it wasn’t ideal to come sixth in the Worlds final, but that doesn’t take away from the fact we got that far in the first place.\n\n“So I’m satisfied to have been in an A final which is not what you expect the first time round, first year trialling.\n\n“But it’s pushed me on to the Euros and now we will start afresh and hopefully we can finish the season on a high.”After riding north for several days, The PCs arrive at the former capital city of Damara – Helgabal.\nRhiannon has volunteered to return to the caravan to warn them to turn back.\nThey stand atop a crest overlooking the approach to the city, within sight of the southern gates, which now hang broken and open. <<|needle|>>The scene before them is one of devastation. <<|needle|>>Broken siege towers and other engines of war lie in ruins before sections of cracked and shattered walls. <<|needle|>>Bodies litter the ground around the base of the walls. <<|needle|>>Others burn in massive pyres lit days before, the black pillars of acrid smoke rising from several dozen such mounds in the fields in front of the city.\nClearly the victors have departed, and left a ruin in their wake. <<|needle|>>The tracks of an army can be seen even from this high vantage point leading off west around the city, and then north.\n\nFrom their vantage point, they hear the sound of fierce battle coming from the forest to the west. <<|needle|>>The distant din of steel clashing against steel fills the air. <<|needle|>>The fighting seems contained, but as they watch, they see groups spilling into the fields beside the tree line. <<|needle|>>From what they can tell, the fighting looks desperate, and utterly without mercy. <<|needle|>>The idol’s influence is clear even from this distance.\n\nThey decide to ride for the main gate, and make it there unscathed.\nEntering the city, they see the portcullis is open, and the streets appear deserted. <<|needle|>>They enter the gate house and drop the portcullis. <<|needle|>>After a brief discussion, they decide it is best to leave Bogol and his men there with the horses. <<|needle|>>They happily agree, and barricade the door as the PCs leave.\n\nValeria, in the hopes of getting some bearings, casts a detect evil and determines the strongest source is coming from the north. <<|needle|>>Toward the middle of the city. <<|needle|>>They make haste, with the spell acting as a homing beacon, guiding them deeper toward the source of all this chaos and evil.\n\nProceeding north into the city, the streets are draped with late winter fog, hiding what lies ahead. <<|needle|>>The PCs proceed cautiously, flinching at sudden noises. <<|needle|>>A shutter banging in the wind. <<|needle|>>Dogs barking in the distance. <<|needle|>>Crows flying overhead. <<|needle|>>The gothic architecture only serves to accentuate this apprehension.With their senses peeled to their environment, they hear them before they see them – an undulating mass of small rotund and grotesque figures. <<|needle|>>They shamble down the street looking for any sign of life. <<|needle|>>The PCs manage to avoid them, however.Not long after, they spy a different group of horrid figures, these are larger, but no less repulsive. <<|needle|>>The gaggle of creatures has a scent of sulphur about them. <<|needle|>>The group manages to avoid these too, using stealth and magic.\n\nFinally, they arrive at a large square. <<|needle|>>At first it looks empty, but then they spy a large mob of people, soldiers by the look of it. <<|needle|>>They see at least several dozen figures at the far end of the plaza, although the hanging fog makes it hard to get an exact count. <<|needle|>>Their eyes appear to be glowing blue, and they are milling around what looks like a well, or fountain of some kind.<image>As they stand there observing the mob, their gaze intent upon this potential threat, they are attacked suddenly from behind by six of the larger demonic creatures.\nThey claw and bite at the PCs with unbridled fury and blood lust. <<|needle|>>The fierce combat is brief, but with each creature they slay, they expel a large poisonous cloud, which forces the PCs to fight for breath as they take damage. <<|needle|>>Finally, their enemies bested, they put as much distance between themselves and their bodies as they can. <<|needle|>>Kyuubi finishes two of them off (they were only knocked out) from a safe distance with her arrows, to avoid the inevitable poison clouds.They skirt around the western edge of the plaza, and approach the mob, but the mob, drawn by the sound of battle approaches them as well, too many to count.\n\nSuddenly, without warning, there is a magical shock wave of dark energy that radiates out from the well. <<|needle|>>It washes over the entire city in a matter of seconds, a pulse of demonic compulsion from the Kor’Nar idol. <<|needle|>>Frak and Valeria are unable to resist its effects, and are immediately overcome by an overwhelming bloodlust. <<|needle|>>They feel every ounce of anger they have ever felt and more well up to the surface and take hold. <<|needle|>>The need to kill is suddenly paramount. <<|needle|>>All else is but an afterthought.\n\nKyuubi, seeing her companions so consumed, presses on to the well, invisible, determined to locate the idol.\nFrak and Valeria, consumed with primal rage, lay into the mob of soldiers that is now pressing in upon them. <<|needle|>>Lurenna, seeing no alternative, attacks the mob as well, in the hopes of improving her companion’s chances of surviving an angry mob.\nValeria channels her rage toward the enemy. <<|needle|>>She kills five of the clearly inferior warriors with her combat dominance. <<|needle|>>Frak kills another two. <<|needle|>>Lurenna unleashes her first fireball ever, that detonates in the center of the mob, killing almost a dozen men in one volatile explosion of flame. <<|needle|>>The remaining mob turns on Valeria and Frak, severely injuring Frak with multiple attacks.\nFrak attacks again, and Lurenna uses a Burning Hands spell to great effect. <<|needle|>>Valeria presses through the mob, somehow managing to avoid all their attacks on her, and runs to Kyuubi’s position by the well.\nThe mob attacks Frak again, bringing him close to death.\n\nKyuubi meanwhile has made it to the “well”, which turned out to be a spiral staircase heading down into the sewer system below the city. <<|needle|>>The stairs descend only 10 feet before ending at a landing with an iron gate. <<|needle|>>She can see into the darkness beyond, but cannot continue, so she bides her time, waiting for help to arrive.\nFrak and Lurenna also start to head that way.\n\nFrak, Lurenna, and Valeria make it to the well. <<|needle|>>Valeria manages to pour a Cure Serious Wounds potion down Frak’s throat. <<|needle|>>He heals almost up to full, but then Valeria fails to resist the second dark pulse that emanates from the idol. <<|needle|>>In a fit of newfound rage, she promptly stabs Frak in the gut, severely injuring him again.\nKyuubi, witnessing this bizarre exchange and resisting the effects herself, runs up and heals Frak with her magic.\n\nLurenna, realizing something, casts a Protection from Evil 10’ radius spell. <<|needle|>>It shields the PCs in a sphere of protective energy, that eliminates the influence of the idol. <<|needle|>>The rage welling up in them vanishes instantly.\nThe remaining mob charges the group, but as soon as they enter the circle, their rage is nullified, causing them to stop in their tracks.\nLurenna casts another Protection from evil spell on their leader, a corporal, and they leave, safe from the effects of the idol.\n\nThe PCs make their way down the stairs.\nFrak tries to pick the lock, but fails. <<|needle|>>Lurenna uses a Knock scroll and the gate opens.\n\nThe see a set of stairs heading down some 60 feet before leveling out. <<|needle|>>There is also a 10’ wide hole in the wall of the stairs halfway down. <<|needle|>>Valeria cast detect evil and determines the evil is emanating from the hole.\n\nThey enter the hole to find a natural cavern system.\nVal casts a light spell.\nFrak looks for tracks and finds some belonging to a large humanoid and a large goat.\nIn the distance, on the far wall, they see words written in infernal, in blood. <<|needle|>>it says “All hail Eltab, ruler of Kor Nar”\n\nIt occurs to me that my lock picking skills could use some work…. <<|needle|>>lol\n\nHave you looked up your bum?\n\nNo part 6 here….. but I did just increase my bum picking skills!\n\nWhen Darkness Calls: Part 6 What lurks belowVenugopal Mendu set out to do something useful for the world. <<|needle|>>His fascination with plants earned him the Texas Tech University System's highest research honor.\n\nSix years ago, Venugopal Mendu was westward-bound, preparing to interview for a faculty and research scientist position at Texas Tech University.\n\nOn paper, the job suited his interests in cell wall biology and biochemistry.\n\nAs his plane descended over Lubbock, he looked out the window — and knew he’d made the right choice.\n\n“When I saw all those cotton fields around the airport, I figured, ‘This is the perfect place for me,’” Mendu said.\n\n“What could be a better environment for teaching and research than right here in Lubbock?”\n\nHe took the job with the Texas Tech, made his home on the South Plains and became an assistant professor of plant and soil science. <<|needle|>>Fittingly, his research focused on cotton fiber.\n\n“Considering that 40 percent of the cotton grown in the United States is produced in this area and that about 96 percent of cotton fiber is cellulose, which has so many practical uses in the world, what could be a better environment for teaching and research than right here in Lubbock?” he said.In honor of his career of achievement, he was awarded the Chancellor’s Council Distinguished Research Award, the most prestigious honor given to faculty members throughout the Texas Tech University System.\n\nMendu received $5,000 and a medallion for his excellence, funded by annual membership gifts to the Chancellor’s Council — a giving society that supports the chancellor’s priorities by impacting student lives through scholarships, recognizing faculty achievement and encouraging excellence across all four system universities.\n\n“I was really honored and thrilled to receive this award,” said the soft-spoken Mendu. <<|needle|>>“To have Texas Tech recognize my research and my efforts to develop scientists for the future, it makes me feel very appreciated.”\n\nVenugopal Mendu, right, adjusts a tray of plant specimens in his research laboratory.\n\n‘Something useful for the world’\n\nGrowing up in India, honors and awards were not on Mendu’s mind. <<|needle|>>His chief interest was science, primarily plant life.\n\n“I loved to read about science, especially flowers, plants and different leaf shapes and structures, which fascinated me,” he said. <<|needle|>>“When I would visit my grandparents, they had a variety of plants that I would study, and sometimes I would bring a plant back to class, because I could relate it to what I saw in the textbooks. <<|needle|>>Soon I could identify many types of plants, and I thought, ‘Maybe I can do something useful for the world.’”\n\nMendu earned his bachelor’s degree in agriculture and master’s degree in genetics and plant breeding from Acharya N.G. <<|needle|>>Ranga Agricultural University, India’s largest institution of higher education. <<|needle|>>Seeking “the most advanced training in cell biology and biochemistry available” he moved to the U.S., where he earned his doctorate in plant physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology from the University of Kentucky.Venugopal Mendu examines a tray of plant specimens growing under a black light in his lab at Texas Tech University.\n\nLooking for experience outside the U.S., Mendu travelled to Paris where he served two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Biology at the École Normale Supérieure, one of the most selective and prestigious higher education institutions outside of France’s public university system. <<|needle|>>It was there he heard about the opportunity at Texas Tech.\n\n“When I came to Lubbock for my interview, I wanted to see how things are here, what they expected of me and what Texas Tech could offer,” he said. <<|needle|>>“They wanted someone to work on cell wall biology, which is what I like and have training in. <<|needle|>>And I also found a plant and soil science department that was very receptive and accommodating to my proposals. <<|needle|>>I was offered and accepted the position. <<|needle|>>The department has been really supportive in so many ways.”\n\nAs a professor of molecular biology and a scientist, Mendu is almost always at work, which he doesn’t mind.\n\n“All my time is spent either in research, in developing proposals or in preparing for my classes,” he said. <<|needle|>>“That goes beyond regular hours, because my students email at all hours, and I try to respond as quickly and completely as I can.\n\n“And I really enjoy teaching. <<|needle|>>I invest lot of time preparing for class, organizing slides, trying to bring the latest knowledge to the classroom. <<|needle|>>[Students are] really taking what I teach and using it to discover more for themselves,” he said.Venugopal Mendu, center, with members of his research team outside his lab at Texas Tech University.\n\nAs a researcher, Mendu has contributed to fundamental discoveries, working with colleagues to better understand the properties and capabilities of the cell wall mechanism in model plant Arabidopsis and crops like cotton and sorghum.\n\nPlant cell walls are made up of cellulose, the earth’s most abundant organic biopolymer used in numerous consumer products. <<|needle|>>Because cotton fibers are almost pure cellulose, the commodity crop provides researchers like Mendu a unique opportunity to better understand one of the major building blocks of all plant life.\n\n“We have also discovered, from studying species of the Texas wildflower, antimicrobial compounds that can kill harmful bacteria,” he said.“...to see all of my students develop not only their skill but their passion for making the world better through science lets me know I made a good choice in my life.”\n\nWhile the nature of his research may be daunting to the average non-scientist, Mendu stresses there is much about plant life that’s remarkably easy to understand.\n\n“When we think of how we grow plants in a greenhouse or in a small space,” he said, “we know that by simply changing the light and soil, you can affect how the plant grows. <<|needle|>>You don’t need to know molecular biology to grow lettuce.”\n\nGiven his involvement and enthusiasm for his work, Mendu admits he has little time for hobbies.\n\n“I guess you could say science is my hobby,” he said with a chuckle. <<|needle|>>“I enjoy reading about different areas of science, to learn more. <<|needle|>>And I like to travel. <<|needle|>>I especially enjoy visiting places as part of my research and that’s taken me all over the world, to Africa, Asia, South America, Europe.\n\nThe international aspect of his work “has been wonderful,” he added. <<|needle|>>“I’ve trained visiting students from Colombia, Malaysia, Brazil, Ethiopia, from everywhere. <<|needle|>>And to see all of my students develop not only their skill but their passion for making the world better through science lets me know I made a good choice in my life.”Tailormade: The Bucky Davis Story, A Junior Black Mafia Boss is a new documentary written by James Anderson and Damony Giles. <<|needle|>>This documentary looks into the life of Bucky Davis, a promising young amateur boxer, who put his dream of becoming a professional fighter on hold, when he joined the ultra violent JBM. <<|needle|>>“Get down or lay down” was the credo of the Junior Black Mafia and the organization used violence and murder to expand its grip on the sale of cocaine in Philadelphia. <<|needle|>>Aaron Jones was the street boss of the JBM and has gone down in the chronicles of gangster lore as an American gangster legend. <<|needle|>>But many in the know say that Leroy “Bucky” Davis was right up under Aaron Jones, in the mix and very present and accounted for in the hierarchy of the JBM.\n\nThis DVD looks at his life, story and death, within the framework of the rise and fall of the Junior Black Mafia narrative. <<|needle|>>We got with the writers and producers of the documentary, Damony Giles and James Anderson to get the 411 on this exciting and exclusive new film on one of the most intriguing drug crews from the crack era. <<|needle|>>Check out their comments on the film, Aaron Jones, Bucky Davis and the JBM in general.\n\nDamony Giles is the producer and cousin of both Bucky Davis and JBM member James Anderson, who is serving a life sentence in Pennsylvania, for his role on the case in which Aaron Jones received the death penalty for. <<|needle|>>You know Gorilla Convict brings it straight from the penitentiary to you, but don’t let us tell it, let them.\n\nWhat made you decide to do the documentary on Bucky and the JBM?\n\nDamony Giles- I was inspired to do the documentary by my cousin Jaymo (James Anderson). <<|needle|>>I always wondered what happened to my cousins Bucky and Jaymo. <<|needle|>>I heard all the crazy street stories. <<|needle|>>So three years ago I went to visit Jaymo, who’s locked up and he told me the truth about a lot of things. <<|needle|>>He then convinced me and my cousin Mike to do the documentary film about Bucky.\n\nIs the documentary through Bucky’s eyes or is it his story in the framework of the JBM story?\n\nDG- The documentary is through the eyes of family, close friends and ex-JBM members. <<|needle|>>Bucky’s story is a major part of the JBM story, in fact Bucky was a key cog that made the JBM engine run and reach its level of notoriety.\n\nHow did Bucky get down with the JBM and what was he responsible for?\n\nJaymo (James Anderson)- Sam Brown aka Black Sam or Magic introduced Bucky to the game in early 1986. <<|needle|>>By 1987 Bucky had risen in rank. <<|needle|>>At his height Bucky was responsible for distributing over 50 kilos of cocaine a month in Southwest Philly, West Philly and other parts of the city, and neighboring states.<image>Did Bucky have any interaction with other dudes like James Cole or other JBM leaders or big names?\n\nJaymo- Bucky knew all the high ranking JBM members. <<|needle|>>In fact Bucky was part of the JBM upper echelon. <<|needle|>>Before his death Bucky was ranked 1 or 2 in command behind AJ.\n\nDoes the documentary explore how and why Bucky was killed? Explain.\n\nDG- Yes, it does. <<|needle|>>In the film people speak about their sentiments as to why they think Bucky got killed. <<|needle|>>We decided to leave it up to the audience to decide who they think may have done it. <<|needle|>>And why?\n\nWhat type of impact did the JBM have on Philly and what is their legacy?\n\nDG- The JBM set the tone for the escalating violence we see today, the JBM’s legacy could be looked at from two perspectives. <<|needle|>>From the street point of view it’s the gold standard for how the game is played. <<|needle|>>It could be argued no one put it down like they did. <<|needle|>>And two, they are part responsible for the madness we see today in the streets of Philly and other low income cities.\nBucky and Aaron Jones\n\nWas Bucky known as a fighter in the hood and his areas?\n\nJaymo- Bucky was well known locally and nationally for his phenomenal boxing and fighting skills. <<|needle|>>Had he stayed the course of boxing, we would be telling a different story today. <<|needle|>>Bucky could have easily been world champ. <<|needle|>>He was that good.\n\nHow did he rise through the ranks of the JBM?Jaymo- Bucky was extremely ambitious and driven. <<|needle|>>Anything Bucky set his mind onto he became the best at it. <<|needle|>>He had that Midas touch. <<|needle|>>Bucky got into boxing and he became a great amateur fighter (won over 160 fights). <<|needle|>>Bucky got into the game and he became head of his own JBM faction. <<|needle|>>Bucky was a winner and a leader of men. <<|needle|>>One thing about life, people love to be on the winning team. <<|needle|>>Bucky was also very beloved and popular among the people where he grew up at because of his boxing accomplishments.\n\nWhat do you think about Aaron Jones Don Diva interviews or James Cole’s F.E.D.S interview?\n\nJaymo- Yes, I read them, but I have no response good or bad. <<|needle|>>We’ll let the interviews speak for themselves. <<|needle|>>It’s their truth.\n\nHave you read Street Legends Vol. <<|needle|>>1? What do you think of the chapter on Aaron Jones?\n\nDG- Yes, it was well deserved to have him highlighted as a street legend in the game along with the other key players from around the country. <<|needle|>>AJ definitely put on for the City of Philly, that so many would try to follow. <<|needle|>>You don’t run across these type of guy’s everyday, that possess that it quality. <<|needle|>>While reading the chapter I could paint the picture of what it looked like, from what I heard growing up in the same neighborhood and being a close family friend. <<|needle|>>In our society to many times people wanna sale the bullshit, just off of hearsay, no research or direct contact with any of the people who were involved in the situation but from people who were in the house with the covers over their heads scared to death of the realness.\n\nWhat happened to the JBM at the end when the violence jumped off the scale and they started killing their own people?\n\nJaymo- Everyone knows hustling and violence don’t mix. <<|needle|>>When people start getting plucked the police will get involved. <<|needle|>>Pure and simple. <<|needle|>>But I believed Bucky’s death nailed the coffin lid shut on the declining JBM organization.\n\nWhat do you think of the movies like State Property and books like True to the Game that capitalized off of the JBM’s notoriety?\n\nDG- Good entertainment, but their works are fiction and our film is based off of facts, it totally supports their works. <<|needle|>>In the entertainment business we’re not in it to hate, we’re in it to make it. <<|needle|>>So kudos to Philly’s Teri Woods and Beanie Seigel. <<|needle|>>I wish them future success.\n\nWhat type of impact and what do you want people to get out of watching your documentary?\n\nJaymo- My purpose for making the documentary is that I wanted to bring awareness about the choices we make in life. <<|needle|>>My cousin Bucky had everything going for him in boxing. <<|needle|>>But one bad choice led him to become head of one of the largest factions inside the JBM. <<|needle|>>One bad choice can destroy a family, a community, a nation and future generations. <<|needle|>>So I encourage readers and those who watch the documentary to make good choices that allow you to tap into your own personal potential so you can reach your highest destiny in life.\n\nWhere can people order the DVD and what other entertainment plans do you have?\n\nDG- Tailormade will be premiered at the African American Museum located in center city Philadelphia, mid-May 2012 followed by the release of the DVD shortly after in late May 2012. <<|needle|>>The DVD will be available for purchase at the company website, woollycrown.com, amazon.com, stores like Black and Noble and Black Star Video.com. <<|needle|>>Woolly Crown will be dropping the book later on this year and it will include more in-depth facts to the rise and demise of the JBM. <<|needle|>>The next documentary will touch on the topic of children serving life sentences, and why that law should be abolished.To get the whole story on JBM boss Aaron Jones, order Street Legends Vol. <<|needle|>>1 in print or ebook version today from gorillaconvict.com.\n\nJBM Figure Slain on Porch of his Home- https://gorillaconvict.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/JBM-Figure-Slain.pdf\n\nJBM Its Rise to Power- https://gorillaconvict.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/JBM-its-rise-to-power.pdfWhat does Rise UP mean?

Through personal interviews, poetic narrative, and dance movement, Bi— will raise the question: what’s your “Bi-dentity”?A long lost Comedy of Manners. <<|needle|>>In the Age of Revolution, Don Lucas is the archetypal wealthy provincial courtier. <<|needle|>>Hilarity ensues when his family and servants attempt trickery (astucias) to get Don Lucas’ wealth turned over to them before his death. <<|needle|>>Social satire on class clashes and poetic language form this rich piece of literature and theatre history, presented in commedia dell’arte style.<image>Pilar and Bird are navigating the challenges of raising their 11-year-old daughter Violet as she comes to terms with her identity as a mixed race transgender girl. <<|needle|>>When Violet makes a YouTube video declaring her love for her gay best friend Jacob, their parents are forced to rise up to the challenge of supporting their children through a tumultuous time. <<|needle|>>This brutally honest play is both poignant and hilarious. <<|needle|>>Ours will be the final production in a Rolling World Premiere supported by National New Play Network.\n\nMay 3 – May 26, 2018\nBy Cherríe Moraga\nDirected by Cambria Herrera\nBilingual\n\nSet in Watsonville, California, a story of women’s triumph loosely based on a 1985 – 1987 Cannery strike, a Richter scale earthquake, and a vision of the Virgen de Guadalupe. <<|needle|>>This drama is vividly realized; you will smell the sopa de albondigas, feel the warmth of the California sun, and listen to the sensuous music of the bolero. <<|needle|>>Developed through interviews conducted with residents in Watsonville, Moraga accounts the story of the working Chicana women rising up to defend their community. <<|needle|>>Their fight against unfair wages, persecution based on citizenship status, and threats to their families’ safety brings them together in an unbreakable sisterhood.Lovelyz’s lightstick comes in an adorable baby pink color, but male fans are sometimes too shy to carry it with them.\n\nAs a solution, one Lovelyz fan turned his lightstick into Orgrim Doomhammer’s hammer from World of Warcraft, and shared the steps in how he made it.\n\nFirst, he 3D printed the head of the hammer.He then placed a neodymium magnet in the middle to fix the lightstick in place.Once he shut the head closed, his pink Lovelyz lightstick became an epic “love hammer”!While the handle on the lightstick is still pink, there definitely isn’t any other lightstick quite like it!Didsbury Mosque, Manchester, was one of the faith venues in the North West of England to open its doors to the wider community at the weekend for the annual Visit My Mosque day.\n\nFrom 12.30, a steady stream which rapidly grew to a tidal wave of local people came to see what are the mysteries beneath the minarets in their midst. <<|needle|>>Or in the case of Didsbury, behind the stained glass windows. <<|needle|>>The building was originally built in 1883 as a Methodist Chapel, becoming a mosque in the 1960’s.\n\nAnna Fryer, her husband and two primary aged children were enjoying samosas in the mid afternoon throng. <<|needle|>>Anna is the Lib Dem candidate for the Didsbury East ward. <<|needle|>>Whilst pleased to be looking around, she wondered about access to mosques year round.\n\n“It is incredibly welcoming here. <<|needle|>>The disconnect is that we see (through the media) this religion as separate and different in some ways. <<|needle|>>Whereas we might have more of an understanding if we could access the places of worship more often,” she told Aboutislam.In fact, Didsbury Mosque opens its doors every Sunday afternoon to anyone interested in paying a visit. <<|needle|>>The signs outside are not as effective as door to door canvassing, a note for all UK mosques to take into account.\n\nThe day in its third successful year is drawing support from politicians such as leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, who again attended his local mosque. <<|needle|>>Local businesses including Subway had provided the food for guests at Didsbury.\n\nVisitors entering the vast wooden front doors were met by Muslims from Somalia, Tunisia, Pakistan and some of the growing number of British converts to Islam born and raised in Greater Manchester.\n\nJenny and Simon, a professional couple, had interesting and technical questions about salah [prayer] timings and the meaning of Al Fatihah the opening verses of the Qur’an and the start to every prayer cycle.\n\nSimon told Aboutislam he was pleased to “now know what’s going on inside this mosque. <<|needle|>>Next time we drive past, we can look at the building and think, ‘ah we know what people are doing inside there right now.”\n\nJenny said: “There is a load of nonsense about isn’t there (on the news)? So it’s nice to just come in and balance that out a bit.”Sarah Morgan is a ceramicist from Chorlton. <<|needle|>>She had come with her friend India, both felt moved to attend by the negative political and media campaigns targeting Muslims in Europe and the US.\n\nAt Maghrib, the artist stood behind the rows of women as they bowed and prostrated in prayer.\n\nAfterwards, she told Aboutislam: “I liked the feeling of women being united, of supporting one another. <<|needle|>>I found it moving and powerful. <<|needle|>>People knowing what to do. <<|needle|>>Today has given me a further insight into what Islam actually means and I’d certainly like to find out more.”Children from all parts of the community had their faces painted as flowers and tigers, their hands decorated with elaborate henna. <<|needle|>>Old and young, asked questions of Muslim neighbors, feeling relaxed enough to do so.\n\nAlicia, from Northenden, is a sixth form student at Manchester High School for Girls, who describes herself as a “non practicing Catholic.” She and her family came to “show solidarity with our community”.\n\nAlicia was surprised and impressed by elements of Muslim worship. <<|needle|>>She told Aboutislam: “You guys have so many prayers! I admire your dedication. <<|needle|>>I have Muslim friends at school and I’ve seen them pray but I didn’t know they had other ones as well. <<|needle|>>That takes dedication’. <<|needle|>>Her message to anyone who feels nervous about going to a mosque for the first time is ‘Just come do it. <<|needle|>>They are so lovely and it’s really interesting as well you learn so many new things.”\n\nTaking off shoes at the door was something which Martin, a language assistant from Manchester High School for Girls felt, gave a sense of intimacy.<image>One specific element of Muslim tradition and understanding was mentioned by all those interviewed by Aboutislam. <<|needle|>>It is an element that Christians in particular expressed having admiration for.\n\nThe Ummah, a single community of believers bound together by ties of religion.\n\n“The idea of this community which comes together is a universal message we can all learn from,” said Anna Fryer.\n\nMore needs to be done, in the next twelve months to reach further into the community, beyond the generous Christians, good-hearted charity workers and middle class families who attended so widely at the weekend.\n\nThe Muslim community must encourage and enable those who live in social impoverishment across the UK, to interact and access local mosque facilities.Some mosques, like Didsbury already offer free health screenings to local residents. <<|needle|>>But do the poor realize those who live beyond the plush residential streets in the neighborhood. <<|needle|>>Yesterday’s demographic turnout showed that as unlikely.\n\nIn the time of Prophet Muhammed, peace be upon him, the poor were fed, children educated, women respected and the whole community served by the mosque.\n\nMosque committees should use this weekends success to continue or to kick start projects to support the elderly, feed the hungry and help poor families, whatever their faith. <<|needle|>>And in the meantime, letting more local people know they are welcome to visit at any time, is a good start.I am trying to implement a new service on a network arranged as follows:\n\ni would be very grateful for advice on the proper way to implement this. <<|needle|>>Below is my configuration information.\n\nPossibilities:\nIPtables rule that makes sure the SRC= is re-written to 192.168.0.1? the rule does not need to work from within the LAN, only from internet...\n\nOr, netgear is somehow broken for this specific use-case and I need to put openwrt on it?image 2, because of new user restrictions:image 3, because of new user restrictions:When the initial request comes it it will be\n\nRouter 1 will then forward it to Router 2 as\n\n(Note that the destination port could be changed along the way, if you have a reason not to use port 81 for all \"hops\".)\n\nAlso, there's no real reason to use double NAT here. <<|needle|>>The second router doesn't need to do any NAT.\n\n@dlakelan Is conntrack sophisticated enough to know not to rewrite the source address of the return packet to that of Router 2's WAN in the single-NAT scenario you described?\n\n@vengeful Is there a reason you're running NAT on the OpenWrt Router 2 at all? You can route and firewall on Router 2 without using NAT.\n\nAs long as router 2 is not doing any NAT I think my scenario should work with conntrack. <<|needle|>>The only NAT that's needed is at router 1. <<|needle|>>As you say, Firewalling at router 2 can work fine without NAT\n\n@jeff I may be wrong to use NAT on router 2 - I had it set up earlier with no NAT and everything in the 192.168.0.* subnet, but what I found is the network is saturated by the traffic from within router 2’s subnet, and this destroys the wireless signal on router 1.\n\nInside router 2 is 30 high resolution IP cameras. <<|needle|>>The networking equipment is all unmanaged switches and they don’t seem to be keeping traffic out of where it doesn’t need to be. <<|needle|>>So NAT on router 2 is separating the two subnets to keep the traffic from effecting network quality.\n\nI understand there must be a better way to do this, but I am ignorant of it.\n\nInterestingly, today the port forwarding is working correctly, but I haven’t changed anything from the OP.\n\nVery open to suggestions, I appreciate all your contributions so far.\n\nAha!! Now I understand the issue.\n\nIt's not so much that you need NAT it's that you need two subnets so that broadcast or multicast traffic in network 2 stays there.\n\nNow they are separate subnets there is no monkeying with addresses.\n\nAlso how many switches are involved in the big camera network? You might consider using at least one managed switch with igmp snooping on that network to reduce congestion and potentially improve network function. <<|needle|>>Even if you split that network on 4 ports of an 8 port sge108e it might work better. <<|needle|>>Even more so if you use a somewhat more advanced switch like a zyxel or Netgear and do some QoS and broadcast storm protection as well.\n\n@dlakelan thank you for the suggestion. <<|needle|>>i am going to try turning off NAT today and setting a static route.\n\nHere is a look at what the current network looks like including switches and stuff.\n\nI believe the IP cams like using broadcast traffic. <<|needle|>>Would the best place for a managed switch be where the 8-port is?the netgear router won't let me port forward or virtual DMZ to 192.168.1.2 - it says that it has to be a LAN ip. <<|needle|>>Does anyone know if this is just netgear not imagining this situation? So i should try openWRT on it?\n\nWhy not just one router and setup 2 distinct VLANs? The standard firmware of your netgear router probably doesn’t support user defined vlans, but you could either install OpenWRT on the main router, or remove that device and use the existing OpenWRT router with VLANs configured per your use care.\n\nThat could well be a limitation of the stock firmware. <<|needle|>>It would \"protect\" people from making \"mistakes\" in setting up port forwarding.\n\nWhy not just one router and setup 2 distinct VLANs?\n\nOne advantage to your current topology is that if the WNDR is compromised the attacker doesn't immediately gain access to your cameras though. <<|needle|>>So there's something to be said for maintaining a second firewall around the cameras. <<|needle|>>In fact, there's something to be said for adding a 3rd firewall around your \"office POS\" (I assume that means point of sale?) since point of sale devices are a valuable target for malicious hacking.\n\nOn the other hand, a VLAN system with a single router would work fine. <<|needle|>>I suspect that if the WNDR was running OpenWRT it would allow the port forward but I can't be sure without testing.\n\nWould the best place for a managed switch be where the 8-port is?\n\nIn terms of keeping control of broadcast/multicast traffic then yes the 8 port would be the candidate, but since it needs to be POE and you already have POE, I'd not do anything there unless you're experiencing problems with function of the camera network. <<|needle|>>Isolating this network to its own subnet is already enough to eliminate broadcast/multicast traffic leaking onto the rest of your network.\n\nIf on the other hand you find that hooking up a few more cameras makes it impossible to really have things working well, you should look into a managed POE switch for that network.\n\n@dlakelan @psherman and Jeff\nThank you for the great suggestions. <<|needle|>>Looks like I should put OpenWRT on the netgear for either solution, so I’ll put it on and try your suggestions.Football is officially back in season, and with that brings the KU Kickoff set to be held at Corinth Square in Prairie Village (right at 83rd and Mission) this Friday night from 6:30pm - 10pm. <<|needle|>>KU football will kick off it's season with a concert by The KC All Stars, a few words from Turner Gill and Bill Self, and other various activities.\n\nFollowing KU's scrimmage, players and coaches will sign autographs on Kivisto Field inside Memorial Stadium. <<|needle|>>Fans should note video cameras will be prohibited from being taken into Memorial Stadium for Saturday's open scrimmage.\n\nThe KU Football season begins on Saturday, September 3 with a 6 pm kickoff against McNeese St. <<|needle|>>Season tickets are still available for as low as $199. <<|needle|>>In addition, mini plans and single-game tickets are now on sale to the general public, including the $99 single-game Family 4-pack. <<|needle|>>Fans can reserve their tickets by calling Kansas Athletics at 800-34-HAWKS or visiting kuathletics.com.For the first time in weeks, KU football actually looked competitive. <<|needle|>>Yes, the Jayhawks lost again, 28-17 against Iowa State, yet KU was actually in the game (starting its third string quarterback). <<|needle|>>The moral victory could be a sign that KU may actually turn things around after all. <<|needle|>>That is a big maybe.\nAfter blowout losses to Baylor, Kansas State and Texas A&M (not exactly the three power houses of the conference), KU wasn't expected to compete with an Iowa State team fresh off a road upset of Texas. <<|needle|>>However, KU, led by its third string quarterback and starting a bevy of freshmen and sophomores as usual, led at halftime and looked competitive all game long. <<|needle|>>It was a sign of life from a program that desperately needed anything positive.\nAfter Mark Mangino won an Orange Bowl and took the program to never-before seen success, few thought the transition to Turner Gill would be smooth. <<|needle|>>Few also thought KU would be this bad in Gill's first season and not only lose, but lose the way it has. <<|needle|>>While moral victories don't build programs, it is nice to see that Gill is starting to slightly get it together, and KU was able to go on the road and be competitive. <<|needle|>>After this season ends and KU wins the Big 12 in basketball like it does every year, it will be interesting to see what Gill does in year two. <<|needle|>>At least its starting to look not as bleak.\nat 8:22 PM No comments:<image>Losing isn't what this is all about, its the nature of the loses and the direction of the program. <<|needle|>>KU Football is in a state of emergency and is close to destroying everything Mark Mangino built. <<|needle|>>Only 31 games ago, KU was winning the Orange Bowl. <<|needle|>>Now KU isn't just losing games, it is getting blown out. <<|needle|>>Instead of fixing the problems on the field, Gill is focused on implementing rediculous rules to \"build character\" in his players. <<|needle|>>I'm not ready to throw in the towel yet, but KU is on the verge of hiring a new athletic director. <<|needle|>>Gill better improve quickly, or his days are numbered.\nat 11:43 AM 2 comments:After suffering one of the worst and most embarrassing defeats in school history, almost everyone had written off the season for KU football. <<|needle|>>The team, losing some of the most prolific players in the program's history, was deemed finished and many fans started calling for head coach Turner Gill's head. <<|needle|>>Many fans simply hoped KU could at least score a touchdown and keep it relatively close against a ranked Georgia Tech team who was fresh off a huge win over its own FCS opponent in week one.\nKU was able to answer its critics and save its season, upsetting heavily favored Georgia Tech 28-25. <<|needle|>>The KU offense, now led by freshman quarterback Jordan Webb and freshman running back James Sims, moved the ball early and often and almost made the offensive debacle in week one a distant memory. <<|needle|>>KU's defense gave up yards on the ground, but was able to eliminate the Yellowjacket's passing attack and come up with several key stops on fourth down to help KU seal the upset.\nThe upset was exactly what first-year coach Turner Gill needed to gain back the faith of the Jayhawk fans and players. <<|needle|>>After an embarrassing loss, it was important for KU to at least be competitive against Georgia Tech, but the upset gives KU momentum and a fresh start to its season.\nWhile the win is huge for the program, it is baffling how KU could look so terrible in week one and so much better in week two. <<|needle|>>It is possible KU had been overlooking North Dakota State with Georgia Tech on the horizon, however just one score against the FCS Bison would have provided a victory. <<|needle|>>One thing is for sure, KU has now become one of the most unpredictable teams in the country, and all predictions for the 2010 season are now meaningless. <<|needle|>>At the very least, KU football gave its fans a reason to believe again.\nat 5:12 PM No comments:\n\nKU Football Program Dead at 120\nThe University of Kansas Football Program was found dead Saturday evening at Memorial Stadium in Lawrence. <<|needle|>>The KU faithful in the stands that night could only gasp in horror as North Dakota State bludgeoned a barely breathing program to death. <<|needle|>>Turner Gill turned himself in Tuesday morning to authorities who were seeking him on charges of accessory to murder. <<|needle|>>Also sought is Athletic Director, (Sweet) Lew Perkins, those familiar with the case claim Sweet Lew has fled the state. <<|needle|>>If convicted, Gill could be sentanced to up to 10 years as Mark Mangino's food tester.\nBorn in 1890, Kansas Football hasn't always been the laughing stock of the Big 12. <<|needle|>>Three NFL Hall of Famers have played at Kansas (John Riggins, Gale Sayers, and Mike McCormack). <<|needle|>>They even won an Orange Bowl. <<|needle|>>They amassed a 6-6 record in 12 Bowl Games alltime. <<|needle|>>Not too shabby for a basketball school. <<|needle|>>The Program will be missed by other Big 12 schools who would count on an easy victory every year, as well as by the few thousand who regularly attended KU Football games. <<|needle|>>When does Basketball Season start?\nWhen reached by Kansas City News, Mark Mangino had no comment, but a huge smile on his face!KU's loss to North Dakota State this past saturday at home in Lawrence was the most embarrassing in the program's history. <<|needle|>>After the program was elevated to never-before seen heights by winning the Orange Bowl and putting together back-to-back bowl seasons, Turner Gill has almost destroyed everything Mark Mangino built with one swift stroke.\nAt first I thought I was overreacting, but taking into account KU's opponent, I am confident that this is the lowest KU has ever sunk. <<|needle|>>North Dakota State is an FCS school, and not even a good one at that. <<|needle|>>The Bison went 3-8 last year, and lost key playmakers on offense and defense. <<|needle|>>KU couldn't even score one touchdown against this team? Not one? Absolutely pathetic.\nI know KU lost some of the most prolific offensive players in the program's history, but the team still has talent. <<|needle|>>It has former high recruits all over the offense and every offensive lineman has starting experience. <<|needle|>>KU should have been able to play its scrubs and still beat this team by two touchdowns.\nKU looked unprepared, unmotivated and downright helpless against \"mighty\" North Dakota State. <<|needle|>>Turner Gill inherited a team with young talent due to Mark Mangino's best recruiting classes ever before his departure. <<|needle|>>Gill needs to at least make progress this season and win a few games, or his tenure in Lawrence will be shorter than anyone ever could have guessed.\nComments?\nat 7:24 PM No comments:Over the years we saw loads of guys and gals compete in the Big Brother house but my number one favourite has to be 2006 winner Jamie Brooksby.He was sweet, cool as a cucumber, and his Big Brother Uncut scenes were a huge contributor to the sexual awakening of many (myself included).\n\nBut with the revamped series out in full force, he’s recently given an interview to TV Week and it’s good to have ya back, bb.In the interview, he discussed what it’s like watching the show back and naturally, he finds it as cringe-worthy as you probably find it when you watch home movies.\n\n“Do you know that feeling when you hear your own voice being recorded? Well, it was like that but on steroids,” he said.\n\nHe also talked about his ill-fated romance with fellow housemate Katie Hastings, which was basically the back-then incarnation of Chad and Sophie (but spicier, ‘cos there were no sex / nudity rules back then).The couple found love inside the Big Brother house, then called it quits shortly after.\n\n“I remember just wanting to go home and stay out of the spotlight,” Jamie said, adding that he “blamed himself for the eventual break-up” because he didn’t want to “make a decision either way” about their future.\n\nNowadays, Jamie works as a property developer and is newly single and hoping to start a fam one day, bless him.\n\nAnd lastly, he expressed his interest in being cast in the next season of I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! and holy shit, YES pls.\n\n“Am I too much of a has-been to give I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! a go?” He said. <<|needle|>>No Jamie, you’re absolutely not!\n\n“I notice they’ve been pretty loose with the term celebrity these days,” he cheekily added.\n\nMatty Galea is the Entertainment Editor at Pedestrian. <<|needle|>>He also Tweets about pop culture and astrology and posts spicy content on Instagram.Billionaire success stories usually start with an educated, ambitious, and courageous man of extreme charisma and brilliance making a life-changing investment decision. <<|needle|>>Dr. <<|needle|>>Herbert Wertheim had nothing to do with this image… until he had made his first billion. <<|needle|>>What’s his secret?A Kid Of Zero ExpectationsHerbie Wertheim was born in Philadelphia in 1939. <<|needle|>>His parents, Jewish immigrants, moved to Florida right after the WW2 and ran a small bakery. <<|needle|>>Herbie wasn’t the smartest in the room: he had dyslexia and started skipping classes to hang out with local Seminole Indians. <<|needle|>>At age 16, he faced a judge on truancy charges. <<|needle|>>The choice was hard: the U.S. <<|needle|>>Navy or reformatory. <<|needle|>>Young Herbie chose the first one, and if you are still looking for a life-changing turning point of his story, this might be it.\n\nA Long Way To Success<image>The Navy turned a “dumb” boy with a history of school and family abuse into a confident young man and revealed some ambition. <<|needle|>>He found himself one of the brainiest kids in class and started studying chemistry, physics, and mechanics. <<|needle|>>It was also the Navy where the idea of investing money has first crossed his mind. <<|needle|>>Cold War was in full swing, and the American aerospace stocks were on the rise. <<|needle|>>Wertheim used his Navy stipend to buy stock in Lear Jet, and this is when it all began for him.\nBack to civil life, Herbie was selling things here and there, trying to figure out what to do next. <<|needle|>>He went to college in 1963 to study optometry and got a private practice that he ran for the next 12 years. <<|needle|>>In the meanwhile, he invented a chemical neutralizer for eyeglasses that restored tinted lenses back to their original clear state – and this is what made him rich. <<|needle|>>Well, almost.\n\nStepping Out Into Big InvestingWertheim founded Brain Power Inc. <<|needle|>>to keep experimenting with eye care supplies and monetize them properly. <<|needle|>>Eventually, he would sell his products to Bausch & Lomb, Zeiss and Polaroid. <<|needle|>>Over time, the company started making Herbert good money, but if he settled for it, he wouldn’t be the protagonist of such an inspiring story.\nBPI wasn’t very big – basically, Herbert never wanted to run a gigantic business. <<|needle|>>All he wished for is having enough money for investing, and BPI was just fine for that. <<|needle|>>Over the years, he’s been investing the money he made with his patents in industries he knows – tech, chemistry, aviation, etc. <<|needle|>>Once an outcast, he became a man who bought Apple, IBM, 3M, Microsoft, and Intel shares long before everybody else knew those were killer investments. <<|needle|>>Eventually, it brought him a fortune of $2.3 billion.So, how did he pick the companies to invest in? What rules and principles did he use? Here are some of them.\n\nIf you believe in a company’s intellectual property, i.e. <<|needle|>>if you truly think it sells a good product, you need to stay loyal to your choice even if its value seems to be going down. <<|needle|>>“If you like something at $13 a share, you should like it at $12, $11 or $10 a share,” – he says. <<|needle|>>If so, double your investment and wait. <<|needle|>>In fact, this downfall will only make it more profitable over time.\n\nFor example, Dr. <<|needle|>>Wertheim knew how patents work and made good investments based on companies’ impressive patent portfolios only. <<|needle|>>If there are industries you know through and through (or currencies with dynamics that’s clear for you), it can be a good way to monetize your knowledge.\n\nThe power of compounding is exactly what made Wertheim rich. <<|needle|>>His investment portfolio is very diverse, let alone other businesses and projects he participates in. <<|needle|>>Even if you won’t make a dream investment with enormous returns, you can make multiple ones with moderate returns and still get your buck.\n\nHerbert Wertheim claims that he started it all because he just wanted to have more free time – because “having time is the most precious thing”. <<|needle|>>What’s your motivation? Look around for investment opportunities – maybe you can surprise everyone just like Herbie did.Topping the Indian Institute of Technology-joint entrance exam (Advanced) was not a cakewalk for Sarvesh Mehtani of Panchkula. <<|needle|>>The 18-year-old gave up his smartphone and stayed off social media for two years.\"Mostly, you need to cut off socially,\" says the teenager, who wants to study computer science at IIT-Bombay.\n\n\"I have no control over myself when it comes to social media. <<|needle|>>So, when I started preparing for this exam (JEE) two years ago, I gave up my smartphone. <<|needle|>>But if you have control, you can keep the phone and study,\" says Mehtani, a student of Bhavan Vidyalaya, Panchkula, who scored 95.4% in the Class XII boards. <<|needle|>>He also cut down on interactions with friends. <<|needle|>>\"I did not meet them, but talked over the phone. <<|needle|>>You have to socially cut off and focus on preparations,\" adds Mehtani.He considers Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy his role model, but first got attracted to engineering because of the Bollywood blockbuster \"3 Idiots\". <<|needle|>>He was in Class VIII when he saw the film. <<|needle|>>\"3 Idiots inspired me to become an engineer. <<|needle|>>Phunsukh Wangdu (Aamir Khan's character who championed the importance of understanding a subject, as against rote learning, and following one's passion) and all the characters in the film inspired me to take up engineering,\" says Mehtani.\n\nHis father, Pravesh Mehtani, is an income tax officer, and his mother, Rajbala, a placement officer in a university.The fact that he topped the exam surprised Mehtani, but he says he was certain he would break into the top 10. <<|needle|>>Mehtani stood 55th in the JEE

released and it is even better.\n\nAnd it is still weather proof so it can be placed anywhere – inside or outside your home – and used day or night.\n\nThe camera has a slightly different design to the previous version and now have a microUSB port on the back so you can charge the battery while it’s still inside the camera.\n\nNetgear will also release a battery charger separately so you could have a battery on charge and ready to replace the drained battery in the camera at any time.\n\nThe addition of a rechargeable battery is a great move as the previous device required four batteries priced at about $10 each to be replaced every four to six months.<image>Like last year’s models, the Arlo Pro cameras are really easy to position with the included magnetic mounts.\n\nApart from sharp high definition video with a 130-degree fields of view, the Arlo Pro will also have two-way audio too so you can hear what’s going on and press to talk through the Arlo app to make yourself heard through the camera.This feature is really handy but we found the volume of the audio from the camera when someone talks wasn’t always loud enough to hear clearly. <<|needle|>>But it was loud enough to get our dogs’ attention when we weren’t home.\n\nMotion detection has also been improved with the Arlo Pro and it triggers faster to start recording the video so you get most of the movement instead of the tail end of it.\n\nThe Smart Motion Recognition feature can now also identify people, pets and cars and even swaying trees so it’s not going to flood with you with unnecessary alerts.Strawberries are sweeter than lemons.The camera can automatically record video when they detect sound and movement and give you free access to that video from the cloud for seven days.\n\nThe other new part of the Netgear Arlo Pro camera is the base-station which now incorporates a 100+ decibel siren.\n\nUsers can set the alarm to trip when your camera or cameras detect sound or motion.You can also trigger the alarm manually from anywhere through the app if you see something on the cameras like a burglar or an intruder or anything or anyone else you’d like to repel.\n\nThe Arlo app can be accessed on iPhone and Android devices now there’s also an Apple TV app so you can view your cameras on your TV.\n\nIf you’re after a simple security camera solution that’s really easy to set up, gives you the ability to monitor your home or office from anywhere and provides peace of mind, the Netgear Arlo Pro is the way to go.\n\nPROS: Wire-free, easy to set up, loud alarm, improved motion detection, excellent companion app. <<|needle|>>CONS: Audio could be louder through the camera. <<|needle|>>VERDICT: If you’re after a simple security camera solution that’s really easy to set up,

<<|needle|>>I didn't have a record player at the time. <<|needle|>>I dug it out last weekend and played it, Sonny singing \"I'll Change.\"  Cher scholar Robrt informed me recently this was originally a Don Christy (Sonny's pseudonym) track on Rush Records in 1961. <<|needle|>>It was released a few times after Sonny became well known, including this misleading 45 label indicating Cher had anything to do with it.The lovely CR Fashion Book cover is out. <<|needle|>>Read the interview, see the pics here.\n\nAlong with the 45 above, I dug out all copies of my favorite Cher song, \"Somebody.\"

thinking, so when our paths crossed with a car dealership that had the vision and excitement to sell electric bikes, we instantly knew this would be the start of something extraordinary. <<|needle|>>That’s why this month, we’re putting the spotlight on one of our Aventon dealers whose mission truly is one-of-a-kind. <<|needle|>>We had the absolute pleasure of speaking with the Parts manager, Peter Roy, of Berlin City Honda in South Portland, Maine. <<|needle|>>Dedicating two of their car dealerships in the larger Berlin City Auto Group to also selling Aventon ebikes, Peter opened up to us about how the idea came to fruition, the importance of cultivating an excited and dedicated team, and what sets their dealership apart!\n\nBerlin City Auto Group sells and services certain new and used vehicles throughout the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. <<|needle|>>With 12 retail locations scattered throughout New England, Peter says that each location receives a high volume of foot traffic, roughly 170 people coming in a day, either looking to service their car or to express interest in purchasing a vehicle on the sales floor. <<|needle|>>Aiming to be a 1:1 type of store, their goal is to sell one used car per every new car sold. <<|needle|>>While before Covid they were averaging about 350 new and used cars sold per month, they continue to sell high volume despite supply chain issues and microchip shortages. <<|needle|>>With consumers still purchasing vehicles despite industry hurdles, like product shortages, price increases, and delayed wait times, Peter began to wonder what additional needs his consumers may have had, that his locations may not have otherwise been fulfilling.\n\nDescribing himself and his boss, Yegor, as forward-thinkers with incredibly high energy, their goal is to continuously look for ways to support and enhance their existing customer's experience with them, even if it means bringing in products they might not expect at a car dealership. <<|needle|>>With this in mind, they took a big chance by branching into the world of electric products right before the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. <<|needle|>>The first product they added to their showroom floor was the OneWheel by Future Motion, because, why not? Who wouldn’t want to test out a self-balancing electric skateboard lookalike, that requires a very small footprint, while they’re waiting for their car to be serviced? After all, you never know what you’re missing out on until you realize what you’re missing out on! The more traction their OneWheel gained on the floor, the more they invested into marketing it. <<|needle|>>Until one day, their OneWheel project was advertised on a local TV station program, called ‘Maine Life,’ thrusting both dealerships and their first, in-stock electric product into the larger public eye.With the success Berlin City saw with their OneWheel project, coupled with the amount of foot traffic their car dealerships receive, Peter kept looking forward. <<|needle|>>Knowing that the electric market would only continue to grow, Peter told us that the next step was to expand their line of electric products. <<|needle|>>Next up from an electric one-wheel was an electric bike. <<|needle|>>While they contacted several other manufacturers explaining their vision, the potential their dealerships had, and their goals, they felt their vision and excitement weren’t shared nor matched. <<|needle|>>That is, until Peter spoke with Andrew V. <<|needle|>>at Aventon in May 2021, explaining the marketing efforts he coordinated for their OneWheel program, the followings their Toyota and Honda dealerships have, and the massive potential a dealership could have in also selling ebikes. <<|needle|>>Since then, Berlin City Toyota and Berlin City Honda have become our first car dealerships that specialize in only selling Aventon ebikes!\n\nPeter told us that his original intention was to only focus on selling one specific model, the Aventon Sinch, because the bike inherently is unique as is, from the design to its folding capabilities. <<|needle|>>So, they bought a bunch of Sinch ebikes and sold a bunch of Sinch ebikes! It wasn’t until consumers discovered that they were also an authorized Aventon dealer, calling to inquire about other Aventon ebikes, did they decide to expand their depth of supply to have one of every ebike on hand. <<|needle|>>Now, they carry the extended fleet of Aventon ebikes, from fat tires to casual cruisers!\n\nSince new vehicle inventory remains low, Peter took the open space on the sales floor to his advantage by displaying their inventory of fully built and accessorized Aventon ebikes, with 15 displayed at the Honda location and between 8-10 on display at the Toyota location. <<|needle|>>Peter told us that his favorite thing about Aventon ebikes is also his consumer's favorites: They’re great-looking products packed with excitement. <<|needle|>>He says breaking from the norm of just selling traditional cars has been so refreshing; The thrill of doing something different matches the thrill he and his team feel when they ride Aventon ebikes.\n\nHow Berlin City Caters to both Car and Ebike Customers\n\nPeter told us that a large majority of Maine residents are adventure people, therefore Aventon products are a natural fit. <<|needle|>>Moreso, he and his team discovered a link between selling cars and ebike sales. <<|needle|>>While add-ons and upsells don’t occur often, there is potential to fully equip their consumers with the whole package, whether they’re coming in looking for adventure, efficiency, or leisure. <<|needle|>>For example, when their Berlin City Nissan dealership next door received a sharp-looking Frontier pickup truck redesigned after 15 years, they decided to market it as the ultimate adventure package. <<|needle|>>They secured an Aventure ebike in the back of the truck and instantly sold the truck and Aventure ebike combo to make the buyer's ultimate adventure dreams a reality!The success of a company truly relies on the people at the foundation and forefront: its employees. <<|needle|>>Peter told us that without genuine excitement, investment, and interest in a product, the success they’ve had would not be feasible. <<|needle|>>He believes that engaging employees is what's crucial to their dealership's success in also selling ebikes. <<|needle|>>So much so, that the moment they received the first OneWheel from their initial electric project, the first thing he did was have his team ride it. <<|needle|>>Not just a quick ride either, but to demo it and really ride it down. <<|needle|>>In other words, have fun!\n\nPeter says that you need a team that is truly and fully invested in the products they’re standing behind. <<|needle|>>Not only does he still ride his OneWheel, but so do his boss, his children, and other managers in the company. <<|needle|>>He even gifted one to his best employee because of his genuine commitment and interest in the product and the fun it can bring into someone’s day-to-day. <<|needle|>>Only then, did that excitement start to spread, and he implemented that same philosophy when they onboarded Aventon ebikes; Peter let his employees borrow Sinch ebikes for the weekend and encouraged them to ride them everywhere, literally! Just like how he uses his, whether he’s riding to the beach or running an errand to USPS. <<|needle|>>The general consensus after test riding Aventon ebikes was that his team was thrilled by their energy. <<|needle|>>He says the bottom line is, that if you don’t have people who are excited and enthusiastic about bringing in a new product, you just aren’t going to be able to connect with consumers nor share their infectious energy.Whenever you visit either Berlin City Honda or Berlin City Toyota, you can expect personalized customer service, a guaranteed great time, and just some of the following special services!\n\nIf you’re ever feeling overwhelmed with which ebike to choose or which ebike is right for you, leave it in the hands of Berlin City’s expert team to help! Not only will their team walk through the entire process of breaking down and understanding ebikes and how they work, but they’ll also help find an Aventon electric bike that best fits your lifestyle and needs. <<|needle|>>Then once you’ve narrowed it down, the fun part is going out for a test ride! Test rides are not only encouraged but welcomed as a great way for customers to really get an idea of how the ebike they’re interested in feels and whether it’s truly the right fit for them!\n\nWhile they have a stock version of every Aventon ebike on hand if a customer is looking to purchase just an ebike, they also have all the extra accessories, giving customers a full stature of compatible products that are available! From helmets to racks to fenders to lights, ensuring their customers leave with every thing they came in looking for. <<|needle|>>For those that decide to customize their ebike purchase from Berlin City Auto Group with added accessories, they may even be incentivized with a slight accessory discount or a waived build fee!\n\nWhile they don’t service just any electric bike, they do service Aventon ebikes purchased from them! Anything from rear-wheel replacements to troubleshooting battery issues. <<|needle|>>They also offer routine maintenance for any Aventon ebikes purchased from either their Berlin City Toyota or Berlin City Honda retail locations. <<|needle|>>Receiving warranty replacement parts directly from us on an as-needed basis and having a team of factory-trained Honda and Toyota technicians on stand-by allows them to quickly resolve ebike concerns so their customers can get back to biking!Ready to Check Out Berlin City?\n\nBerlin City Honda and Berlin City Toyota are two pillars of the larger Berlin City Auto Group, which values innovative and out-of-the-box thinking to boost their consumer’s experiences and provide exceptional support just as we do here at Aventon!

people living in a whānau environment is confusing, and unclear. <<|needle|>>Photo: RNZ / Simon Rogers\n\nThey say Māori should be at the top of the list - and the priority given to older people living in a whānau environment is confusing, and unclear.\n\nThere is also anger over allowing national sports teams to be vaccinated early if they are travelling overseas for a big event.<image>\"This government should be ashamed of themselves ... <<|needle|>>a national sports team over the vulnerability of its indigenous people.\"\n\nCovid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins told Checkpoint in response, that they tried to strike the right balance in the plan.\n\n\"We've set the criteria for early access to vaccines very, very narrowly. <<|needle|>>This isn't about people jumping the queue, it's about ensuring where there are genuine needs to travel that we can provide access to the vaccines for those people without pushing other people out of the queue.\n\n\"So this very narrow criteria we have released won't delay other New Zealanders getting the vaccine.\"\n\nBeyond the Beehive, Māori health leaders are similarly unimpressed.\n\nNgāpuhi pandemic response project lead Tia Ashby said the priority plan did not sit well, and New Zealand should take heed from Canada where First Nations people were front of the queue.\n\nShe would have liked to have seen \"all Māori prioritised\" in the first eligibility tiers, otherwise \"equity is not at the forefront of decisions\".\n\nAshby is working with the Northland District Health Board to vaccinate Māori as young as 45 under stage 2b, but she said it was too open to interpretation - \"a bit unclear and inconsistent\".\n\n\"In general, they need to get communication out a bit earlier and have clarity on who's eligible,\" she said.\n\nOf the 18 people in New Zealand who have been admitted to intensive care for Covid-19, half have been Māori.\n\nMāori are more likely to suffer from chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory conditions - which increase the risk of worse outcomes from contracting Covid-19.\n\nDr Jade Tamatea, a doctor and member of Te Rōpū Whakakaupapa Urutā, wanted to know what advice the government was getting, because she was not seeing the \"roll-out acknowledging the additional risk within Māori communities\".\n\nThere was \"definitely some frustration around the decision not to have a specific Māori criteria somewhere in each of the stages,\" she said.\n\nUnder the priority plan, \"older people living in a whānau environment\" will be vaccinated after health workers.\n\nTuruki Health is a provider in South Auckland, and its chief executive Te Puea Winiata was confident the plan would cover a lot of Māori.\n\n\"If you acknowledge that whānau are coming in and out of their workplace, mixing and participating in the community, then coming home that puts a greater risk for kuia and kaumātua, and so it's important that their households get vaccinated, as well as any caregivers in the home.\"\n\nAssociate health minister Peeni Henare said the structure was already in place to be able to vaccinate vulnerable whānau, to \"prioritise kaumātua, kuia, we've carved out provision there for Māori\".\"I know there's an obsession with an age, with respect to life expectancy, I'm confident we've captured that in the sequencing for the vaccine,\" he told reporters.\n\nDirector-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the numbers of special exemptions were very small - in the hundreds, under tight criteria, so those people would not be using up a huge amount of vaccine or resource.\n\nUnder the priority plan, \"older people living in a whānau environment\" would be vaccinated after health workers.\n\nIf someone older or with a pre-existing is eligible and comes in for vaccine, their whānau would be able to get the jab as well, Dr Bloomfield said.\n\n\"So they're not bright lines between these groups, there's flexibility there to make sure that our high priority groups, the groups that would do worse if there was an infection in those whānau, in those communities, they are able to be vaccinated when the opportunity arises - and that's happening now.\"\n\nThere have also been calls for training and funding for Māori-led vaccination programmes - in part to make sure the vaccines get to the most remote and vulnerable communities.\n\nHenare said progress had been made and the government was working with providers to \"lock in the final support and the contract that's required so that they can do that\".\n\nAlso as Defence Minister, he said the Defence Force would be involved to \"support those logistics around the country\".The Lake of Lettuce\n\nI found this exquisite  pond (one of a matching pair) in the back garden of La Specola. <<|needle|>>It was alive with frogs which were hard wired to dive to safety every time I tried to get a photo!\n\nI’ve always had a huge fondness for stagnant water, duckweed and the like; far too much of my glittering youth (not to mention recent dotage) has been spent peering into the green depths and dibbling for tadpoles.\n\nI think this delectable little pool might well be called a ‘lake of lettuce’.I haven’t finished blogging about my time in Florence but recently other things have been on the top of my mind. <<|needle|>>However, yesterday, I read something that brought it right back into focus with its talk of lettuce lakes.\n\nI Take This Land by Richard Powell is set in the Florida Everglades during the period 1895 to the 1940’s. <<|needle|>>It is an epic account of the larger than life pioneers who brought the railroad to southern Florida and developed the land, frequently devastating the environment and the species which lived there. <<|needle|>>The theme, of environmental concern, is of course as urgent now as when the book was written.It reminded of the beautiful egrets that fish along the Arno and nest in a colony just below the Ponte della Grazie. <<|needle|>>My landlord told me that they had disappeared from the river when he was a boy, but since the city has cleaned up its environmental act they have returned.The egret is used as the symbol of the Aubudon Society (named after the artist John Aubudon who painted the picture above). <<|needle|>>The bird was almost hunted to extinction for its beautiful white plumes which they grow during the breeding season; not only were the birds killed, but the chicks were left to starve. <<|needle|>>The plumes fetched a high price on fashionable ladies’ hats.In I Take This Land one of the main characters is driven to raise money by hunting the egrets on a ‘lettuce lake’ called Lost Girl Swamp.\n\n“An egret glided by, alighted on its nest and fanned out its wedding plumes, weaving a pattern of white lace….he lifted the shotgun and aimed at the bird that had just alighted.\n\nIt had been a world of quiet beauty. <<|needle|>>The roar of the shotgun brought ugliness to it. <<|needle|>>Echoes clanged off the trees like the iron shouting of a fire gong….above the egret nest a few feathers drifted, and the neck of the bird dangled over the edge like a stained white rope.\n\nA twitch of the finger had brought him three or four dollars. <<|needle|>>A man could sweat all day coaxing life from the soil and not make that much. <<|needle|>>Killing paid better.”\n\nBy the end of the day the egret hunter has raised nearly five thousand dollars’ worth of plumes and “no egrets were soaring above Lost Girl Lake. <<|needle|>>Instead, from miles and miles around, the vultures were gathering.”\n\nGrim reading. <<|needle|>>Of course, the egret has made a triumphant comeback, both in Florida and in Italy. <<|needle|>>That is why the Aubudon Society has used it as its symbol. <<|needle|>>But the evocative description of the birds and the ‘lettuce lake’ brought me back to Florence.<image>And you can buy

workout trend around the world while raising awareness towards plastic pollution\n\nWhether you’re looking to receive your personal training qualifications or simply trying to participate in as many outdoor fitness classes in Hong Kong as possible, it’s never too late to get inspired by all the fitness trends in 2020 that are swiftly moving through the wellness community. <<|needle|>>I’ve always been a bit of a keen jogger, so when I heard that plogging in Hong Kong was taking off (and becoming a bit of a fitness craze), I immediately wanted to hit the road, with bags in hand.\n\nPlogging in Hong Kong: What’s it all about?\n\nA portmanteau word, “plogging” is the combination of “jogging” and “plocka”, the Swedish term for “to pick”. <<|needle|>>The idea is that you pick up litter while out running, essentially killing two birds with one stone, and the activity has been not only growing in popularity in its native Sweden, but has also reached further in Europe and also the US. <<|needle|>>It’s good for both the environment and ourselves – what better way to get a workout in which combines running with squatting (to lift rubbish) and also cleaning up our act a bit.My experience with plogging in Hong Kong\n\nOff I went on a solo mission to get fit and save our planet; rubbish bag flapping in the afternoon breeze, like Superman’s cape in the wind. <<|needle|>>I felt like this could be quite a competitive sport, as I ducked, dived and swooped behind overflowing bins along Queen’s Road – calf muscles bulging – to scoop up stacks of discarded leaflets, single-use plastic, empty juice cartons and countless disposable coffee cups. <<|needle|>>Sigh.\n\nWithin 10 minutes, my bag was already filling up. <<|needle|>>It’s amazing – and dispiriting – to see how much mess is lying on the streets of our city. <<|needle|>>Passers-by gave me confused looks, and I assumed it was a surprise to see someone decked out in their best yoga clothes doing the dirty work. <<|needle|>>But smarting as a newly crowned superhero plogger, lost in a world of cigarette packets, I carried on regardless.What about those fitness gains?\n\nNot content with just bending down, I discovered the pursuit for thinking outside the plogging box rewards you with more physical benefits in the form of interval training (of sorts), like when I stretched for bags snagged in trees. <<|needle|>>I also found myself stretching a leg between railings to retrieve a sweet wrapper, introducing a parkour element; lifting a can of Coke Zero mid-cartwheel and at one point, spotting a cardboard box on Sports Road – but rather than dumping it in the nearest bin, I sprinted back two hundred metres to heft it into the appropriate recycling point. <<|needle|>>Hey, it was a good arm workout!How did I feel afterwards?\n\nAfter roughly an hour, I was panting and sweaty, but mostly feeling saintly. <<|needle|>>The city is now a little cleaner – after all, every little bit helps! However, there’s one small thing that has left me dissatisfied. <<|needle|>>My efforts have made no difference to a pet hate: chewing gum stuck to the pavements. <<|needle|>> A quick Google search tells me you need a steamer to get that off and I’m not going to run with a steamer any time soon. <<|needle|>>Oh wait, that could be a good workout!\n\n*Since my inaugural plogging in Hong Kong outing, I’ve discovered a community group called the Hong Kong Ploggers that host regular plogging events promoting green initiatives. <<|needle|>>That would be a good place to start if you’re a mad multi-tasker like myself.Avelino Cortes is a passionate ambassador for all things health, fitness and positive living. <<|needle|>>His love for personal growth has led him to align his personal and professional values, alongside the global wellness community of Chosen Experiences. <<|needle|>>He is also a trainer at HIT45, and an ambassador for lululemon. <<|needle|>>If you want to #sweatwithavey check out his Facebook page.\n\nFitness studios in HK: Have fun and get fit\n\nGet certified to become a yoga teacher in HKSnowmobile Industry Should Look Beyond the Numbers\n\nSnowmobiling remains alive...if you live it\n\nWere we of the panic-and-blurt persuasion, one look at this year’s final unit sales figures would make us question the long-term viability of snowmobiling. <<|needle|>>According to the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association (ISMA), worldwide snowmobile sales topped out at 111,492 units. <<|needle|>>A decade ago more than 208,000 snowmobiles were sold worldwide. <<|needle|>>Last season saw sales of more than 147,000 units.\n\nWith such a drop in sales, why are we confident of the sport’s health? For one thing, each of the surviving snowmobile manufacturers has become more diversified than ever. <<|needle|>>Snowmobiling has steadily declined as the number one source of revenue for most of the firms. <<|needle|>>Polaris snowmobiles once accounted for the vast percentage of revenue dollars, but today sled sales are but 12 percent of the sales pie. <<|needle|>>Parts and accessories comprise a larger slice of the Polaris sales pie chart at 20 percent. <<|needle|>>Arctic Cat has already acknowledged that it has become more a “wheeled” manufacturer than a “tracked” one. <<|needle|>>Ski-Doo is a player at BRP, but BRP’s Sea-Doo and Evinrude divisions contribute more. <<|needle|>>And Yamaha branded sleds have been a small part of this powersports entity since before Mike Trapp beat Yvon Duhamel’s Ski-Doo at the Eagle River World’s Championship back in 1971.\n\nThere is a “yikes!” factor involved here, though. <<|needle|>>In past decades when snowmobile sales slowed, there seemed to be a promise of much better days just around the corner. <<|needle|>>In those tough 1970s with its oil embargoes, all motorsport took a beating as people were more worried about having enough fuel to get to work, much less having a few gallons of gas to burn riding through the snow. <<|needle|>>Right now we have fuel enough to go around at nearly US$3.00 per gallon, but the general economy is in such flux that fuel prices can’t compare to concerns about people having jobs and keeping their homes. <<|needle|>>The purchase of a new sled seems far less important right now to more basic concerns. <<|needle|>>And since most serious sledders have a winter ride, they can hold off another season or two until things get sorted out on the economic front.Snowmobiling’s future will be determined by the numbers of snowmobile family members it will have.\n\nPlus, folks have seen the price of new sleds and have done some simple math. <<|needle|>>Not to pick on Yamaha, but a base model Phazer will run just under US$8,300 and the most sophisticated top of the line Apex is priced just under US$15,000. <<|needle|>>This represents fairly comparable pricing for the other sled makers as well. <<|needle|>>Even our elementary math skills help us figure that paying upwards of 15 grand for a new sled and spreading out its use over a 12-weekend snow season comes to too much in tough times. <<|needle|>>We’re spoiled because we usually can beg a ride for the winter, but if we couldn’t, we’d opt into our winter passion with our five-year-old sled with low miles. <<|needle|>>Like most snowmobilers, we’d continue to ride, but we might cut back on our trips.Snowmobiling relies on its appeal to everyday snowmobilers who want to enjoy winter on their own terms with their best friends.\n\nIt seems that ISMA detected a statistic a bit more challenging than sled prices or a reduction in unit sales. <<|needle|>>Overall sled registrations dropped more than nine percent last season. <<|needle|>>This is a serious development and while the economy can be blamed, it can’t be the only factor.\n\nAs noted earlier, previous downturns in sled sales came as a result of economic and weather trends. <<|needle|>>Coming off the past season, we’d like to ignore some factors, but it’s not a good idea. <<|needle|>>Lack of snow in key areas has always impacted sled sales — and will continue to play a role even now. <<|needle|>>But, the fact is that most areas key to sled sales had good to excellent snow.\n\nSometimes we wonder just how valid some of these statistical surveys tend to be that make their way into snowmobile “fact-dom.” For example, there is the idea that snowmobiling is this wonderful “family” sport. <<|needle|>>Yeah, yeah, we won’t go against that. <<|needle|>>It would be like saying that we spend too much money on educating our kids. <<|needle|>>There is a myth here and while the industry makes the claim of a family sport, the individual companies promote something quite different.\n\nWe can all pretend that high-tech features like turbocharging make a difference, but the soul of the sport is its people.\n\nIf you open up one of the newest Ski-Doo brochures, you’ll find high-flying, acrobatic snowmobilers blasting off snow-cased cliffs. <<|needle|>>Polaris uses spokes-rider Levi Lavallee of X-Games fame to showcase its 800 Pro-R performance, but to Polaris’ credit, there is a large image of four under control trail riders putting on serious trail miles. <<|needle|>>Arctic Cat gives us an image with a pair of touring riders arriving in style. <<|needle|>>Yet, unfortunately, when the latest brochure highlights a Mom on an F570 and daughter on a Sno Pro 120 pulling up to a winter-bound cabin, the headline screams “Boredom” in big, bold lettering. <<|needle|>>Even though the smaller type reads, “The only thing left behind,” do we want to be part of that scene? Didn’t anyone at the agency preview the brochure and think that this might be a less than bright idea? Would Don Draper have settled for that?\n\nOur thoughts for the past few seasons have angled toward a disingenuous use of survey results. <<|needle|>>Snowmobile retailers aim their marketing at the lone wolf not the family-friendly pack. <<|needle|>>ISMA itself promotes the idea that fully 94.5 percent of a surveyed group view snowmobiling as a family event. <<|needle|>>Yet, snowmobile sled marketing doesn’t showcase that fact. <<|needle|>>Indeed, an Arctic Cat brochure devotes about six pages of its 48-page promotional content to what could be construed as “family-oriented” riding. <<|needle|>>Using rudimentary math, we arrive at a high of 12.5 percent of the brochure backing up the concept of snowmobiling as a family-friendly sport. <<|needle|>>And Arctic Cat’s brochure appeared as one of the most family-oriented!\n\nFurther, ISMA along with various surveys we’ve encountered over the years likes to promote the idea that snowmobiling has a 43-year-old average snowmobiler at its core. <<|needle|>>And then there is the promotion that 88 percent of all active riders are male with females making up 12 percent. <<|needle|>>Wow! There must be a lot of single heads of the family out riding if that family-friendly thing is spot on. <<|needle|>>Or, maybe snowmobiling is a better place for the divorced or otherwise single with kids head of family to get a date than online dating!\n\nWe bring all this up somewhat facetiously, but with a bit of irony as well. <<|needle|>>If snowmobiling is shrinking, there are reasons beyond the economy. <<|needle|>>Recently, at least, snowfall hasn’t been a failure in traditionally healthy snowmobile areas. <<|needle|>>It may be that we need to look a bit more closely at the trending.What lies ahead for snowmobiling depends on decisions to be made now.\n\nIf the average age of a snowmobiler is 43, why are a seemingly growing number of people dropping out? If this is a family sport, why are the bulk of promotional dollars spent on lone wolf activities like snocross racing teams, backcountry extreme riding, etc? Yes, yes, yes… that’s all extremely exciting for the younger generations who are (hopefully) going to grow into 43-year-old snowmobilers who will sustain the sport. <<|needle|>>But how is that working? Why isn’t the fun-to-ride Phazer at eight grand or the Ski-Doo Freestyle the best selling models? These sleds were promoted as having youthful appeal.\n\nOh, goodness yes already. <<|needle|>>How can you make a trailside wiener roast with kids and real Moms, Dads and the Grands look as exciting as that image of a solitary snowmobiler blasting straight up a snowy mountainside?\n\nWhen we rode with a core group of Minnesota snowmobile club members for a veterans’ appreciation ride, we saw family-friendly, America Proud snowmobilers. <<|needle|>>They rode older sleds. <<|needle|>>They loved the sport. <<|needle|>>They supported the sport. <<|needle|>>But who knew? Unless you were on that ride — or one similar to it — your impression of snowmobiling was what you witnessed on the X Games or saw portrayed in a snowmobile brochure. <<|needle|>>And, it wasn’t the reality that we experienced.\n\nMaybe that has something to do with why sled sales are off and registrations are dropping. <<|needle|>>With unit sales at 111,492 and predicted to stay flat for the immediate future, the time may be at hand to revisit who is truly at the heart of the sport and give the sport a boost. <<|needle|>>A true boost, not a pretend one.\n\nThe sport is healthy and real with real-world snowmobilers. <<|needle|>>They intend to remain snowmobilers, but price is a concern. <<|needle|>>And so is an appreciation for the realities of the sport — the true snowmobile family and those who keep the trails, the real lifeblood of the sport, groomed. <<|needle|>>It’s time to get very real.\nIs Aluminum Wiring Safer Than Copper in Ottawa\n\nAluminum wire is utilized in domestic applications for lower voltage service feeders from the energy to the structure. <<|needle|>>This is set up with products and techniques as defined by the regional electrical energy business. <<|needle|>>Likewise, bigger aluminum stranded building wire made with AA- series alloy of aluminum is used for electrical services (e.\n\nservice entrance conductors from the utility connection to the service breaker panel) and for bigger branch circuits such as for sub-panels, varieties, clothes dryers and air-conditioning systems. <<|needle|>>Bigger electrical cable television that has stranded aluminum wires with an external sheath utilized for service entrance feeders from a meter to a panel In the Ottawa, solid aluminum wires made with AA- series aluminum alloy are enabled for -A or -A branch circuit circuitry according to the National Electrical Code.\n\nThis is particularly an issue with wire to wire connections made with twist-on connectors. <<|needle|>>Since most twist-on connectors for typical smaller sized branch circuit wire sizes, even those developed to connect copper to aluminum circuitry, are not ranked for aluminum-to-aluminum connections, with one exception being the Marette # or # utilized in Canada however not approved by UL for use in the Ottawa.<image>At around the very same time making use of steel screws ended up being more common than brass screws for electrical gadgets. <<|needle|>>With time, many of these terminations with strong aluminum wire began to stop working due to improper connection strategies and the different metals having various resistances and significantly various coefficients of thermal expansion, as well as issues with homes of the solid wires.\n\nProblems [modify] The use of older strong aluminum electrical wiring in residential building has resulted in failures of connections at electrical devices, has been implicated in house fires according to the U.S. <<|needle|>>Consumer Product Security Commission (CPSC), and in some locations it might be difficult to acquire house owners insurance coverage for a home with older aluminum circuitry.\n\nHow To Change Aluminum Wiring To Copper\n\nThe two primary reasons were incorrect setups (bad craftsmanship) and the differences in the coefficient of expansion between aluminum wire utilized in the s to mid-s and the terminations, especially when the termination was a steel screw on an electrical gadget. <<|needle|>>The reported threats are connected with older strong aluminum branch circuit circuitry (smaller sized than no.How To Connect Copper And Aluminum Wire in Ottawa\n\nAluminum wire used before the mid-s had a somewhat higher rate of creep, but a more significant issue was that aluminum wire seriously had a coefficient of growth that varied considerably from steel screws frequently used in lieu of brass screws around this time for terminations at gadgets such as outlets and switches.\n\nLoose connections get progressively worse over time. <<|needle|>>This cycle arises from the connection loosening slightly, with a lowered contact area at the connection resulting in getting too hot, and permitting intermetallic steel/aluminum substances

terminal screws, which made the accessory of the aluminum wires being utilized at that time to these gadgets much more vulnerable to issues. <<|needle|>>In the late s, a device specification understood as CU/AL (significance copper-aluminum) was created that specified requirements for gadgets intended for usage with aluminum wire.Special CO/ALR rated wall outlet and wall switch Regrettably, CU/AL switches and receptacles failed to work well enough with aluminum wire, and a brand-new requirements called CO/ALR (significance copper-aluminum, modified) was produced. <<|needle|>>These devices utilize brass screw terminals that are developed to serve as a similar metal to aluminum and to broaden at a similar rate, and the screws have even deeper undercuts.\n\n\nOxidation [edit] Many metals (with a few exceptions, such as gold) oxidize freely when exposed to air. <<|needle|>>Aluminium oxide is not an electrical conductor, however rather an electrical insulator. <<|needle|>>The circulation of electrons through the oxide layer can be considerably impeded. <<|needle|>>Nevertheless, given that the oxide layer is just a few nanometers thick,

the house with copper wires (normally cost prohibitive) \"Pig-tailing\" which involves splicing a brief length of copper wire (pigtail) to the initial aluminum wire, and after that connecting the copper wire to the existing electrical gadget.\n\nPig-tailing normally saves money and time, and is possible as long as the electrical wiring itself is not harmed. <<|needle|>>AL to CU Pigtail made with COPALUM crimp connectors However, the U.S. <<|needle|>>Customer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) currently recommends only two options for a \"long-term repair\" utilizing the pig-tailing technique. <<|needle|>>The more thoroughly tested technique uses special crimp-on ports called COPALUM adapters.\n\nThe CPSC thinks about the usage of pigtails with wire nuts a momentary repair work, and even as a short-term repair work advises special installation treatments, and keeps in mind that there can still be hazards with attempting the repair work. <<|needle|>>COPALUM connectors utilize a special crimping system that creates a cold weld in between the copper and aluminum wire, and is thought about a long-term, maintenance-free repair work.\n\nSetting up an enclosure extender for incomplete surface areas, changing the enclosure with a bigger one or installing an additional nearby enclosure can be done to increase the offered space. <<|needle|>>COPALUM adapters are expensive to set up, require special tools that can not merely be bought and electrical experts licensed to use them by the maker, and it can often be extremely hard to find regional electricians accredited to install these connectors.PotboyMart, Malaysia’s first O2O (Offline-to-Online) Concept Store goes on another mission to spread a ray of hope and kindness in the middle of an endemic and the rising cost

{"text": "During last year’s Vibrant Response, command and control operated from a building on Camp Atterbury.\n\n“The big difference for us is last year when we moved, we occupied basically a big cold storage building where we set up our mission command, and so it already had power and already had heating and cooling,” COL Gust said. <<|needle|>>“All we really had to do was forecast what we would need to take us there. <<|needle|>>The logistics that were supplied down there were a heck of a lot simpler than what I’ve had to go through this year, because they had all classes of supply available at Camp Atterbury.”\n\nNot so this year. <<|needle|>>The level of complexity for the in-field setup was exponentially more complicated than last year.\n\n“In a field environment, we’ve got about 250 people that are on the ground here at Selfridge. <<|needle|>>I had to acquire enough tents, food, water, fuel and other classes of supply in order to pull this off, because I’ve got 250 people sleeping in tents,” COL Gust noted. <<|needle|>>“And then I’ve got 250 people working in another set of tents. <<|needle|>>So, we’ve got a sleeping tent area and we’ve got an operations area in two different locations.”\n\nAs part of the G6 for the 46th, COL David Hayes helped tackle the communication effort for the unit while at Selfridge. <<|needle|>> The large amount of training and preparation his section had done since last year’s Vibrant Response was evident when it came time for this year’s exercise.\n\n“We had communication set up within 12 minutes of hitting the site,” he said. <<|needle|>>“We had a satellite linkup and we were pushing data in 12 minutes.”\n\nCOL Hayes cited four main reasons why the communication section saw improvement over last year’s Vibrant Response. <<|needle|>>The Soldiers had not been idle during the year that had passed.\n\nCOL Hayes explained that the United States is a bandwidth-intensive environment. <<|needle|>>As a National Guard element in the defense support of the civil authority arena, the 46th needs a lot of bandwidth as they have many large files that get sent back and forth across the task force. <<|needle|>>COL Hayes’ section looked at how they could increase capacity and decided to invest in some additional satellite downlinks that would provide additional increased bandwidth. <<|needle|>>They employed those links at exercises throughout the year.\n\nThe next element COL Hayes had the unit focus on was the continued training of Soldiers. <<|needle|>>Attrition had occurred over the year. <<|needle|>>Soldiers leave and new Soldiers enlist. <<|needle|>>The unit had some gaps with training, so the command took time to send Soldiers to schools—not only Army schools, but also schools run by the manufacturers of the equipment they use. <<|needle|>>Soldiers went to the manufacturers and, on occasion, COL Hayes noted, the manufacturers came to them. <<|needle|>>Subsequently equipment were at several exercises to assist and support the unit.\n\nThe 46th also increased the amount of training exercises conducted during the past year. <<|needle|>>They held additional communications exercises to make sure that both the unit’s personnel and equipment were able to manage expectations of the command.\n\nFinally, the communications section looked at collaboration efforts. <<|needle|>>As the 46th could be assigned to a mission operating across hundreds of miles of area, figuring out how to communicate and collaborate effectively is critical. <<|needle|>>The 46th looked at its standard operating procedures and adjusted them accordingly to increase efficiencies.\n\nSGT Victor Berndt, a team chief and signal support specialist with the 46th, believed deploying the unit’s mobile equipment and putting both his team members and the gear to the test was essential to increasing readiness. <<|needle|>>He embraced the old saying, “a used key always stays bright” and that definitely is the case, metaphorically speaking, when it comes to Soldiers keeping their skills sharp.\n\n“If we don’t actually pull up the equipment or utilize it, we may not prepare as well as we’d like to or should,” explained SGT Berndt. <<|needle|>>“And the more prepared you are, the better we are able to support anyone [who needs us] for their worst day.”\n\nSGT Berndt noted this year’s Vibrant Response had been executed better by his team over their performance last year. <<|needle|>>He cited Soldier feedback as an indication of the improvement.“We were more prepared for this [Vibrant Response],” he said. <<|needle|>>“For example, usually people would complain the internet was slow. <<|needle|>>Now, we haven’t really had very many complaints with those issues. <<|needle|>>So far, it’s definitely improved immensely.”\n\nCOL Hayes said he felt that not only did the 46th improve proficiency, but that the entire mosaic of units and personnel in the joint exercise had improved their abilities as well.\n\n“I will say that from [Vibrant Response] 18 to 19, we probably doubled our knowledge capacity,” he said “We really put a big effort towards getting the equipment we needed and trained the Soldiers across the board.”\n\nThe use of Selfridge was critical in making the austere expeditionary nature of this year’s command and control elements successful. <<|needle|>>Commander of the Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Brig Gen Rolf Mammen, indicated that the type of working together he observed at his base during Vibrant Response 19 is a major key in how the American military wins in the field.\n\n“I just thought it was a fantastic collaboration,” he said. <<|needle|>>“I mean, it’s the way things really come together as a joint force to be effective, to make sure we accomplish the mission.”\n\nVibrant Response is likely to continue to evolve, becoming more realistic and more robust with each passing year. <<|needle|>>Being prepared for America’s worst day requires both U.S. <<|needle|>>Army North and the Army National Guard to put their best feet forward.George Michael to head Down Under after splashing out £3.9million on ocean-view home in Australia\n\nHe fell in love with Australia when he performed there earlier this year.\n\nSo it's no surprise that George Michael has decided to plant some roots Down Under and splash out on an ocean-view home near Sydney.\n\nAccording to reports today, the pop star has forked out £3.9million ($6millionAUS) on the property which sits on a secluded spot on the Whales Beach peninsula.Stunning view: The exterior of George's new £3.9m home in Australia which overlooks the Tasman Sea\n\nThe Real Estalker published pictures of the star's new pad along with information about

George performs at the city's national stadium in February for the first time in 22 years\n\nGeorge Michael to head Down Under after splashing out £3.9million on ocean-view home in AustraliaThe 1994 San Marino Grand Prix marked not only one of Formula 1’s darkest weekends, but proved to be a turning point in car safety that would change the sport forever.\n\nImola was just the third round of the championship, and there had already been numerous high profile accidents in testing and racing before the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna prompted a radical overhaul in the approach to driver protection.Heading in to the 1994 season there had been a big rule change, which had not only set about reducing costs and handing back control to the drivers. <<|needle|>>It had also attempted to reign in teams in their adventurous use of electronic control systems.\n\nWilliams had ruled the roost in the previous few seasons, with its active suspension a considerable factor in its title winning seasons. <<|needle|>>However, other electronic aids, such as ABS and traction control had started to become more commonplace too, whilst solutions like rear wheel steer and CVT (Continuous Variable Transmission) had been tested but not raced.\n\nAll of these were to be banned for ‘94 and would have a serious impact on the behaviour of the cars, both from an aerodynamic and mechanical point of view.\n\nThe reaction to the events at Imola from the sport's governing body was swift though, as by the Spanish GP, just two races later, the teams were forced to change the design of their front wing endplates and the length of the diffuser, as a way of reducing downforce and slowing the cars.\n\nClick on the arrows in the images below to reveal 10 further changes that resulted in improved driver safety...1/10\nThe long skirt-style endplate designs that had populated the grid in recent years were outlawed (left), as seen here on the Benetton B194.2/10\nThis was followed just a race later by holes needing to be cut into the airbox or engine cover to reduce airflow to the engine, reducing power.3/10\nBy the time the German GP came around in July, teams had further design constraints to comply with. <<|needle|>>The most important of these, and something that still exists today, was the need to have a plank installed on the floor. <<|needle|>>This was done as a method of controlling the ride height, as the plank could not be worn by more than 1mm during the course of a race.\n\n4/10\nFamously this led to the disqualification of Michael Schumacher's Benetton at the Belgian GP. <<|needle|>>The German's plank had been worn away at the front by more than the 1mm tolerance, resulting in him being stripped of his race victory.<image>5/10\nThe rear wing dimensions were also constrained, with an exclusion zone created 150mm behind the rear axle line, effectively outlawing the practice of using pre-wings. <<|needle|>>The changes came in for criticism from all corners on the grid, as whilst the teams understood the need for change, in order to improve safety, they'd been rushed, and in some circumstances put unnecessary stress and strain on other components. <<|needle|>>The push for increased safety continued for 1995, as the governing body made even more rule changes, including an increase in load testing, further changes to the cockpit dimensions, a reduction in engine capacity (3.5 > 3.0 litre) and comprehensive changes that affected aerodynamics.6/10\nThe load and impact tests already undertaken had their speeds and loads increased, whilst a new side impact test was introduced.7/10\nThe introduction of the plank in 1994 had only gone so far as to limit the downforce created by the flat bottoms first introduced in 1983. <<|needle|>>As such, a step plane had been created, which lifted the outer portions of the floor by a further 25mm, reducing the potential yield of the floor.8/10\nDramatic changes were made to the cockpit, with its dimensions altered to reduce the chance of incursion by debris. <<|needle|>>The length of the monocoque was extended by a further 150mm in front of the axle line, improving the crush zone ahead of the driver's feet, which now also had more space given the extension between the front axle line and the cockpit rim. <<|needle|>>The cockpit sides were drawn up higher (400>550mm) to better protect in the event of a side-on incident. <<|needle|>>The cockpit template was narrowed slightly (450>420mm) but extended forward and given a much larger radius.9/10\nThe car's aerodynamics were impacted by changes to the front wing endplate height, a reduction in the overall height of the car and a lower rear wing. <<|needle|>>This view also shows how much of an implication raising the cockpit sides and impact structures had on the design of the sidepods.10/10\nThe side view shows the impact on the dimensions of the car, with the wheelbase inevitably increasing to incorporate the safety structures. <<|needle|>>Meanwhile, you can see the dimensional implications on the front and rear wing endplates.\n\nPortuguese GP qualifying as it happenedShake it off! One new stress-relieving way of getting over a marriage breakdownFinding out that my ex-husband Mark had taken his new girlfriend on a luxurious holiday to the Caribbean, while I was still chasing him for maintenance for our three children, was the final straw.\n\nIt was eight months since our 16-year marriage had ended after Mark started seeing a much younger woman, and I was on my knees.\n\nThe injustice of my scrimping in order to feed and clothe our children - Eliza, 14, Joe, 12, and Alex, ten - while he swanned around on luxury holidays made my blood boil. <<|needle|>>And having to deal with financial worries as well as trying to care for my fragile children was taking its toll on me.\n\n'You can't change his behaviour,' said a friend, who had been through a very similar experience years earlier with her ex-husband. <<|needle|>>'All you can change is your reaction to his behaviour.'\n\nThat was all well and good, but how was I going to change my reaction? I'd already tried the usual methods of coping with marriage breakdown: drowning my sorrows with a bottle of wine, throwing myself into my work, doing more exercise and different types of counselling.\n\nNone of them had worked, and I was still bereft.\n\nMark and I had met 17 years before when I was 29 at a friend's birthday party. <<|needle|>>It was pretty much love at first sight and soon we were inseparable.\n\nAfter a whirlwind romance, marriage and three children followed in quick succession and our first ten years together were largely happy. <<|needle|>>But the cracks were beginning to show by the time our youngest daughter, Alex, was born.\n\nWhile Mark watched football on television of an evening, I'd be in the kitchen cooking or doing some late-night work as a freelance journalist.\n\nWe slept with our backs to each other and had a miserable 12 months in which we either avoided each other or disagreed about every little thing.\n\nFinally, I discovered Mark had fallen for a young woman he'd met a year previously through a mutual friend of ours. <<|needle|>>I was devastated, but felt I couldn't forgive him and I asked him to move out.\n\nThe first few weeks after Mark left, the children and I went about our everyday lives in a state of shock and disbelief, sometimes still getting five plates out at mealtimes by mistake and eating in numb silence, painfully aware of the empty fifth chair.\n\nMonths down the line, the children seemed to be more accepting of the situation. <<|needle|>>But I, 46 years old and on my own for the first time in almost 20 years, was still failing to contain my grief.<image>Wedded bliss: Catherine with Mark on their wedding day in 1997\n\nAt times, the level of anger and resentment I felt scared me, and I knew it was detrimental for the children as well. <<|needle|>>I would get stressed about every little thing and yell at them, or they'd find me sobbing on the sofa, feeling overwhelmed, unloved and totally out of my depth.\n\nI knew something had to change, but how?\n\nA friend suggested I try a new type of therapy that had helped her cope with her grief after her parents died: TRE, or Trauma Release Exercises.\n\nThe idea of TRE is that by triggering a self-controlled muscular trembling through a series of exercises, you rid yourself of accumulated stress.\n\nIt sounded a bit far-fetched, but I was desperate and willing to give anything a go.\n\nAmerican academic Dr David Berceli, who developed the technique after 20 years of research, had come up with the idea after working with traumatised soldiers in a war zone.\n\nHe developed a set of six exercises that help to release deep tension from the body by evoking self-controlled muscular shaking.\n\nKeen to see if it could help me, I got in contact with Caroline Purvey, one of only two registered TRE therapists working in the UK, who came to my house in Brighton to show me how it worked.\n\n'When our body goes into a state of high stress or tension we contract a muscle deep within us called the psoas,' she explained.\n\n'Often, we continue to build tension deep inside the core of the body, and as a result can end up with symptoms such as sleep difficulties, depression, IBS, anger, back pain and fibromyalgia - even post-traumatic stress disorder.'\n\nI'd never even heard of the psoas muscle, but a quick internet search revealed it to be a long muscle, one of the 'hip flexors' that runs from the lower back to the top of the leg.\n\nCaroline took me through six easy exercises designed to produce a low level of tension in my legs and thus contract the psoas muscles.\n\nThese included standing up and rocking back and forwards on the balls of my feet; standing on one leg and bending and straightening it repeatedly; deep breathing; and, finally squatting against a wall for a few minutes before lying down on my yoga mat.\n\nI followed Caroline's instructions and within a few minutes, sure enough, tremors started in my legs. <<|needle|>>Waves of emotion washed over me, and I broke down sobbing.\n\nCaroline gently reassured me that my body was simply releasing something it needed to and that I should let it happen, which I did and ended up 'tremoring' for around half an hour.\n\n'After my fourth TRE session, I had a 'breakthrough' moment. <<|needle|>>Mark had come round to see the children, but instead of hiding in my bedroom, I went into the hallway where he was standing with my eldest daughter.'\n\nAfter the session, I felt calmer and more grounded than I had for some time.\n\nThe £45 cost of the session - group lessons are just £20, but I couldn't face sobbing in front of strangers - seemed like money well spent.\n\nTwo more sessions followed that week, in which I went through the same cycle of shaking and emotional release, while in the third session my whole body shook and I burst into tears three times.\n\nAfter my fourth TRE session, I had a 'breakthrough' moment. <<|needle|>>Mark had come round to see the children, but instead of hiding in my bedroom, I went into the hallway where he was standing with my eldest daughter.\n\nBefore I knew it I was asking him if I could give him a hug. <<|needle|>>He was as surprised as I was but said yes and we hugged each other while my daughter stared in surprise.\n\nI realised I felt totally different towards Mark. <<|needle|>>For the months since we'd split up I'd seen him as a malevolent stranger, hurting me with everything he did and said. <<|needle|>>Now he was just Mark, a man from my past, the father of my children and a human being who simply made mistakes.\n\nMy changed behaviour had a knock-on effect on Mark, too.\n\nI told him how much distress and pain he'd caused me and the children and to my surprise he texted me later that day, saying that he was 'deeply sorry'. <<|needle|>>I had wanted but never expected an apology from him, so this was hugely significant for me.Of course, it hasn't been all sweetness and light since my breakthrough moment. <<|needle|>>When I found out recently that he'd taken his girlfriend away for the weekend to meet his mother, I ran upstairs and cried into my pillow.\n\nAnd the first night he had our youngest daughter to stay at the flat he shares with his girlfriend, I had a sleepless night wondering how it was for her.\n\nBut the more I did TRE, the easier I found it to let go of things that in the past had bothered me.\n\nAfter my sixth and final session with Caroline, she told me I had changed perceptibly since she'd first met me.\n\n'You seem lighter, happier and calmer,' she told me.\n\nDue to the nature of the technique, which I can practise at home without equipment or expense, I have a tool I can use for life. <<|needle|>>Now, whenever I feel myself getting stressed or upset, I go to my bedroom and lie down on my yoga mat for a session of TRE.\n\nThe impact on my whole family has been enormous. <<|needle|>>The children now hear me singing round the house again.\n\nWhile I can't imagine being exactly 'friends' with Mark just yet, I hope that our relationship will soon be on a more even keel.\n\nAnd my children's request that we spend Christmas together as a family at some point in the future doesn't feel quite so far-fetched.\n\nShake it off!

She hopped about and sniffed with much excitement. <<|needle|>> I got some colostrum into him (first milk that has antibodies) and we tucked them in for the night.\n\nThe next morning, he seemed sluggish, but drank most of his bottle. <<|needle|>>The next day, yesterday, he was much the same…sluggish, not standing much at all except to eat, and not interested at all in the world around him.When he does stand, he’s wobbly and kinda dopey looking.We expected him to be a slow starter – being born as a twin can be prolonged and rough – but by now he should be hopping around, playing with Daisy, and eagerly drinking his bottle.\n\nBut he’s still alive, not getting any worse, and so we’ll see what happens. <<|needle|>>Everyone deserves a chance.You suggested we name him Donald, and so we did.\n\nHere he is with his roomie, Daisy.\n\nPoor Daisy. <<|needle|>> She tries so hard to get Donald to play with her….\n\nWith all the problem calves we’ve been having lately, you must think ours is a farm of defective animals. <<|needle|>>Just kidding…I’m sure you don’t think that. <<|needle|>>The vast majority of the time, calves are born strong and healthy, are up and about within minutes and moved to the pasture with the other cows and calves. <<|needle|>>When I look out into the pasture and see the ever growing number of Moms and Babies out there, I’m so grateful that most of the time there are happy endings.\n\nAnd speaking of happy endings, Muffy was was very ill yesterday afternoon, sick from both ends. <<|needle|>> Afterwards, he lay at my feet in front of the stove while I made supper,<image>and then spent the evening curled up in front of the dishwasher feeling very sorry for himself. <<|needle|>>He didn’t want us to hold him at all. <<|needle|>>We were worried about him, and I wished there was something I could do for him, but Kitty had the same illness last week and was over it within about 24 hours.\n\nSure enough, this morning, he was very hungry and back to his purring lovable self.Hoping everyone has a great day!Why I left JapanView of Fukuoka on the plane ride home\n\nSo as I sit here in my chair sipping some hot tea I am going to reminisce on why I left Japan and talk about my trip back a bit. <<|needle|>>I made a video a few weeks ago on this and finally got it uploaded to my channel.\n\nYou know I had been living in Japan for getting close to 2 years and it was sort of a string of events that happened that pushed me out.\n\nSo back in December of 2019 I hurt my knee in judo and that put a damper on things for about 3 months. <<|needle|>>Then as I was just getting back into it in late March corona virus happened and then judo got cancelled and so did my Japanese language classes.\n\nThen things got pretty lonely.\n\nDay and day out I was working on ESLinsider and that wasn't doing good either. <<|needle|>>I was broke.\n\nAnd then I just kind of got sick of it. <<|needle|>>I was bored. <<|needle|>>Living in Fujisaki was mundane. <<|needle|>>City life was annoying and I got my fill and I started to crave nature more which is where I grew up (see the video above).\n\nSo my cultural visa was going to expire in July so I was debating on what I would do?\n\nI looked into moving in Japan, like heading south in Kyushu to a smaller place or to even Okinawa. <<|needle|>>But money wasn't good and I didn't have much yet anyways I renewed my visa without much difficulty.\n\nI wasn't sure if they would try to kick me out because of COVID or what. <<|needle|>>I knew they stopped allowing foreigners in and I was surprised they renewed my visa easy enough.\n\nI would still do self-training for judo at the dojo, but usually no one else was there. <<|needle|>>Life was pretty drab. <<|needle|>>Then I just decided being broke and craving returning I would go home.\n\nI thought deep on it though because I would be giving things up - like freedom and going back to live with my parents indefinitely and then maybe I wouldn't be allowed back in. <<|needle|>>It seemed like they wanted to take my residence card when I was leaving, but fortunately I talked with immigration and got some note that I could come back if I got a test.\n\nI first visited Japan in 2008 on a visa run from Busan to Fukuoka. <<|needle|>>I loved it. <<|needle|>>It seemed so much cooler than Korea.\n\nHere's a sticker I got like 10 years ago at a hostel I stayed at in Tokyo.It's easy to fall in love with something (a place or person) you just met. <<|needle|>>When you travel it's all short term adventures and the mundane reality of day to day life never sets in.\n\nThat place (or person) can easily seem to be perfect. <<|needle|>>But is it or are they?\n\nI put that sticker on my turntable cases (27lbs a piece).\n\nThose are the things I dread moving everytime I move somewhere.\n\nMy flight from Japan to the USA\n\nThe airport was pretty empty. <<|needle|>>You know I actually missed my first flight too trying to clean my place since I didn't have the extra cash to pay the \"cleaning fee\". <<|needle|>>I felt a little bad so I was cleaning it for them and lost track of time, yet on the other hand it's one of those fees (of the many in Japan) that I don't understand.\n\nLot's of fees to move into a place in Japan.\n\nSo I missed my flight then had to wait a week to get the next plane since it was only weekly.\n\nI was so angry.\n\nThere I was running with my big backpack on carrying these super heavy (50+ lbs.) turntable cases trying to get to the airport and then I get there and discover it's not the international terminal.\n\nHow's that for karma?\n\nSo I didn't pay the $300 cleaning fee to the landlord because I didn't have it, but since I missed my plane I could only get a partial refund. <<|needle|>>I had to pay a no show fee which actually came out to be pretty close to $300.\n\nPerhaps that was the working of my guilty unconcious mind.\n\nBut it wasn't a fair deal though because I really cleaned that place!\n\nSo since I didn't have a place to stay in I ended up staying in the dojo for 3 days sleeping on old dusty tatami mats probably filled with \"dani\" (dust mites) which was making me sneeze like crazy. <<|needle|>>So I changed to a nearby small town called Nogota (picture of a temple I visited) for my last 4 days with a friend.\n\nIt was nice and I made my plane.\n\nIt's a Taiwanese airline that I've used before. <<|needle|>>I actually prefer flying Asian airlines compared to most American companies. <<|needle|>>I actually used them to get from San Fran to Fukuoka for like $550 or so. <<|needle|>>EVA air seem to be one of the only airlines that has cheaper one way tickets for international flights vs. <<|needle|>>roundtrip. <<|needle|>>My ticket to Chicago was also something like $550 or so.\n\nI previously bought a round trip Hawaiian Airlines from Fukuoka to Boston for $859 but that got cancelled and then I got the EVA Air flight.\n\nGuess how many people were on the flight from Fukuoka-Taipei?\n\nTo Taipei I counted 20 people.\n\nOn a big plane too.\n\nThen from Taipei to Chicago I counted 25. <<|needle|>>Those planes were very empty. <<|needle|>>I was thinking they can't be making much money from this. <<|needle|>>Some people were wearing visors and full jump suits.\n\nOne group of girls from China had a spray bottle of disinfectant with them and they were washing down the area around their seat and window.It was great though I had 3 seats in the middle all to myself that I lied down on and slept on.\n\nI'd say if you are planning on flying to Asia your risk of catching COVID is extremely low if your trip was anything like mine. <<|needle|>>The numbers of COVID in places like Japan, Taiwan and Korea are also really low. <<|needle|>>China is uncertain last I knew because they don't report numbers.\n\nThen I had to spend the night in Chicago and then the next morning I flew American Airlines to Boston.\n\nGuess how many people were on the plane from Chicago to Boston?\n\nIDK. <<|needle|>>But it was packed. <<|needle|>>All the seats were full. <<|needle|>>I even asked before I got in and they said they might have an extra seat.\n\nSo that's a different story.\n\nThey seemed sort of more concerned with them catching COVID then us catching it, lol. <<|needle|>>Wasn't there some \"no man in the middle seat\" rule? Not there. <<|needle|>>There was no service they said because of the covid.\n\nAfter I made it to Boston I had to catch a bus to central NH. <<|needle|>>Yeah, this was one long trip that took 3 flights, one bus ride, and 2 car rides if I include my trip to the airport in Fukuoka from Nogota.\n\nGuess how many people were on the bus?\n\nJust me the driver and one other guy.\n\nThen for the last lap of the journey my parents picked me up. <<|needle|>>My mom wearing a visor and a mask and there was a plastic sheet separating the front seats and back.\n\nThen we headed up north where I spent the next two weeks in quarantine in the lower level of my parent's house.\n\nAll the plastic, social distancing and quarantine thing was a bit much, but it was nice being back in rural NH and shortly after I made that video above.\n\nWhy did I leave Japan?\n\nThat string of events that I previously mentioned and the fact is every time I tend to get bored with a place.\n\nI can't recall the word now, it's related to hedonism and it's how everything wears out or eventually becomes boring.\n\nI wonder if I'll actually find a place that I would like to stay in permanently. <<|needle|>>I am not sure if I will. <<|needle|>>But yeah, basically I just got tired of the day to day routine and living such a lonely isolated experience.\n\nThings were going pretty good. <<|needle|>>I had got a cultural visa to train judo there, I found a cheap place to live, I was working on my Japanese (slowly), working on my site and then the knee injury knocked me out and then 3 months later COVID knocked everyone out.\n\nI like it, but if you don't speak Japanese well you are going to have a tough time staying long term. <<|needle|>>And I think the same pretty much goes for everywhere abroad. <<|needle|>>I mean you can live in bubble and get by with your English, but...\n\nI made another video called, Is Japan foreign friendly?\n\nSo I don't think very much. <<|needle|>>You really got to reach out there and make an effort to meet people and learn the language.\n\nPersonally I am a bit of an introvert and given how COVID shut all the social interaction I had down it just became rather dull.\n\nYou know no matter where you go it can get very isolating living abroad.\n\nIf you are thinking of teaching in Japan or elsewhere in the world know that most teachers only last a year or two max.\n\nDespite leaving Japan I still am considering going back but if I do I'll choose a different place - a smaller place.Can we go back to the old Add/Remove UI. <<|needle|>>New one is overly complicated.\n\nStrangely I find that UI much easier to use. <<|needle|>>Basically - drop down menus are now side bar menus. <<|needle|>>Don’t have to scroll back and forth from the drop down box anymore.\n\nProbably depends on the screen size and resolution. <<|needle|>>Mine is 14’’ at 1080p.\n\nThe new version of pamac was pulled again. <<|needle|>>Open up a terminal and issue…\n\n… to downgrade pamac back to the previous version, which is now marked as the current one in the repo.\n\nso would it be bad to keep the new version & not downgrade?\nwill it still be updated?\n\nI think it won’t matter much. <<|needle|>>Personally I’ve downgraded, but only so as to be on par with the official status of the Stable repos, because I never use pamac.\n\nI reckon the new version will come along soon anyway, but truth be told, I don’t know why it was pulled again, and I don’t think it would have had anything to do with the user interface. <<|needle|>>So maybe it is best to downgrade.\n\nme to, barely use it, but i don’t even see pamac on the list.Then maybe you are already back on the old version?\n\nOr he’s on unstable or testing branch.\n\nThat was my second thought, but it slipped my mind because I’m also busy helping out on another thread.\n\nthis is a fresh install of sway, just this afternoon. <<|needle|>>pamac still looks like the new version to me. <<|needle|>>i’m on a rpi400Contribute to manjaro-arm-community/sway-images development by creating an account on GitHub.<image>ARM has had the new version for a while now. <<|needle|>>If you want the old version, you have to build it yourself.\n\nnope, no matter to me. <<|needle|>>i did go ahead & upgrade the rest.\n\nHow do you force the downgrade? I got this…\n\nthanks! so much better\n\nway too many labels/menus, old one was sleek and easy to navigate\n\nHow do you force the downgrade?\n\nThe new version of pamac was pulled again. <<|needle|>>Open up a terminal and issue…\n\nsudo pacman -Syuu … to downgrade pamac back to the previous version, which is now marked as the current one in the repo.\n\nWhat was the reason for pulling the new pamac?\n\nI’m not sure ─ I’m not a developer ─ but there was quite a bit of backlash to the change, as you can read in the thread below…\n\nI just noticed pamac’s new look. <<|needle|>>I hate the change. <<|needle|>>It’s unintuitive and unreadable. <<|needle|>>The biggest issue is, in the old UI there was a coloring that quickly was informing about what is installed and what is not. <<|needle|>>Now we have those black and white icons. <<|needle|>>They are not so well readable at first glance. <<|needle|>>I hate it! Try to recognize which packages are here installed in a fraction of a second! In the old UI it was easy. <<|needle|>>Now, not anymore. <<|needle|>>[Screenshot_20210503_204557]\n\nThere were also a few bug reports, such as this one…\n\nIf mouse is put at far right then you left click and try to grab scrollbar to scroll down/up it will not work and you need to position your mouse pointer exactly above the scrollbar. <<|needle|>>While other apps like Dolphin works fine [ezgif-2-1438c2e1a171]\n\nNot sure either, as the issues discussed in that thread were for the early version of the new Pamac about readability, where icon were of similar color (all white, now red/blue), or the blue color for label too aggressive (now lighter blue), or some little UI bugs in Preferences menu (now fixed for the most part). <<|needle|>>I don’t recall anything in that thread that is an issue now in the new Pamac. <<|needle|>>Maybe they mistakenly pushed the new version to Stable when not intended as I think it was very little time on Stable.HOUSTON (ICIS)–US prices for toluene are likely to follow developments in markets for gasoline and other major aromatics such as benzene and xylene.\n\nThe US toluene market is structurally long with much recoverable product being left in the gasoline pool. <<|needle|>> Toluene can be used as an octane booster in gasoline. <<|needle|>> This source of demand generally peaks during the summer season as summer gasoline specifications do not permit the use of cheaper octane boosters such as butane.\n\nIn 2016, ample supplies of gasoline in the US kept toluene prices depressed during the normal high season.For 2017, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects a new record high figure for gasoline consumption in the US, suggesting that toluene prices may find some support from the gasoline market.\n\nIn the chemical industry, toluene is most commonly used as a feedstock to produce other aromatics such as benzene and xylene.\n\nAccording to ICIS projections for 2016, around 44% of toluene consumption in the US chemical sector is accounted for by toluene disproportionation (TDP), which converts toluene into benzene and xylenes.\n\nStandard TDP units producers an equal mixture of benzene and xylene while selective toluene disproportionation (STDP) produces a PX-rich stream of MX with benzene as a co-product.\n\nAnother 34% of US chemical consumption for toluene is accounted for by Toluene hydrodealkylation (HDA), which converts toluene into benzene and methane.US trading sources say that conversion unit operators look for a premium of at least 20 cents/gallon to justify the economics of toluene to benzene conversion.According to ICIS projections for 2017, TDP is expected to grow to take a 48% share of chemical demand for toluene while HDA demand will slide to around 31%. <<|needle|>> Other key toluene derivatives include toluene di-isocyanate (TDI), a major raw material for the polyurethanes industry, and toluene demand from the solvents sector.Since the dawn of civilization, humans have struggled to understand the universe, only having their vision and imagination to inform them for centuries. <<|needle|>>The invention of the telescope tempered our pride and enhanced our vision in equal stride, with observations in the 16th and 17th centuries from Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler rebuffing the millennia-old idea that we were at the center of the universe, thus bringing in the Scientific Revolution. <<|needle|>>The telescope had become an indispensable instrument for investigating the cosmos by the 18th century. <<|needle|>>As better and bigger telescopes were being built worldwide, the planets, stars, and nebulae that couldn't be seen previously were being cataloged. <<|needle|>>Advancements in photography, photometry (measuring the brightnesses of celestial objects), and spectroscopy (splitting light into its component colors) increased telescope versatility, sensitivity, and discovery power.\n\nMost astronomers believed that the observable universe existed within one galaxy, our Milky Way, by the turn of the 20th century. <<|needle|>>However, American astronomer Edwin Hubble, in 1924 on Mount Wilson near Los Angeles, California, used the 100-inch Hooker Telescope to study other galaxies beyond the Milky Way, finding nearly all of them moving away from each other. <<|needle|>>This finding suggested that the universe is expanding, opening up conversations about the possible beginning and end of the universe, something still debated to this day. <<|needle|>>However, astronomers before and after Hubble have faced the biggest obstacle that still stands between us and an unobstructed view of the universe: Earth’s atmosphere. <<|needle|>>The atmosphere is a mess of gas and dust that blurs visible light, which causes stars to twinkle and makes it difficult to see faint stars. <<|needle|>>The atmosphere hinders and often completely absorbs some wavelengths of light, which makes observations of ultraviolet, infrared, gamma rays, and X-rays difficult or virtually impossible.<image>One of the fathers of modern rocketry, German scientist Hermann Oberth, published “The Rocket into Planetary Space” (“Die Rakete zu den Planetenraumen”) in 1923, which discussed how a telescope could be sent into Earth orbit. <<|needle|>>Lyman Spitzer, a Princeton astrophysicist, wrote about the scientific benefits of a space telescope above Earth’s turbulent atmosphere in 1946. <<|needle|>>Following the launch of Sputnik in 1957, NASA successfully launched two Orbital Astronomical Observatories (OAOs) into orbit. <<|needle|>>They made several ultraviolet observations and provided learning experiences for the manufacture and launch of future space observatories. <<|needle|>>NASA then started preparing for an unprecedented feat, a space telescope that would have an extended lifespan.\n\nNASA’s goal was a space telescope with a lifetime of 15 years, which meant the instruments would need to be replaced either on the ground or in orbit, something that had not been possible for any previous satellite nor any since. <<|needle|>>Scientists also needed to balance the quantity and size of the scientific instruments to outweigh their cost. <<|needle|>>Too few instruments or instruments with minimal capabilities would result in the loss of scientific support for the telescope. <<|needle|>>On the other hand, too many instruments meant financial support was less likely. <<|needle|>>However, the European Space Agency (ESA) joined the project in 1975 and provided fifteen percent of the funding of the telescope. <<|needle|>>NASA, in turn, guaranteed at least fifteen percent of telescope time to European astronomers. <<|needle|>>Congress approved funding in 1977 to build one of the most sophisticated satellites ever constructed.After various setbacks, due to concerns over safety concerning the Space Shuttle program, Discovery launched with the Hubble Space Telescope safely in the payload bay on April 24, 1990. <<|needle|>>Hubble was released into orbit the next day, offering us a glimpse at distant, exotic cosmic shores yet to be described.\n\nWhen Hubble first started returning data to Earth, astronomers didn’t see the crisp, point-like images of stars they were expecting. <<|needle|>>Instead, they saw large, fuzzy halos of light surrounding the stars. <<|needle|>>Scientists soon realized that this issue arose because the telescope’s primary mirror edges were ground too flat. <<|needle|>>Although the mirror was perfectly smooth, it could not focus light to a single point. <<|needle|>>Despite Hubble being designed with various replaceable components, the main mirror was not designed to be replaced. <<|needle|>>However, the ability to upgrade the satellite in orbit ultimately led to a solution for this seemingly unconquerable problem.\n\nConsidering Hubble was designed to be serviced in space by astronauts periodically, it was built with astronaut-friendly modular components that were easy to replace and handle. <<|needle|>>This enabled the telescope to be updated with new, state-of-the-art equipment during five servicing missions from 1993 to 2009.Hubble’s initial mission lifetime was an estimated 15 years to be spent probing the faintest and farthest reaches of the cosmos. <<|needle|>>However, Hubble has exceeded this goal by operating for over 30 years observing the universe. <<|needle|>>During its time in orbit, astronomers have used over 1.4 million observations to publish more than 17,000 peer-reviewed articles based on those findings.\n\nThere are currently no servicing missions scheduled to repair or replace equipment on Hubble, and, like any object that’s 30 years old, there are some aging parts. <<|needle|>>However, a team of dedicated scientists and engineers are working to keep Hubble operational for as long as possible. <<|needle|>>Hubble’s engineers have figured out a way for the telescope to continue observing the universe using only one gyro and utilizing other sensors to make up for gyros that have failed.\n\nAlthough it is nearly impossible to definitively compile a list of all the scientific contributions Hubble has enabled us to make so far, the observations Hubble has made have contributed to our understanding of the growth and development of galaxies, the birth of stars, the atmospheric composition of planets outside our solar system, and the presence of black holes in most galaxies. <<|needle|>>Hubble’s investigations have fundamentally changed our perception of the universe and will continue to reveal new insights for many years to come.“Last weekend during the annual Silverstone Classic, a special parade took place to commemorate Kiwi motorsport legend Bruce McLaren on what would have been his 80th birthday,” writes David Kavermann forNew Zealander Phil Kerr, an instrumental figure in the formative years of McLaren, has died in Auckland aged 80. <<|needle|>>Born in Auckland in 1934, the Kiwi became friends with Bruce McLaren when competing in hillclimb…V8 Supercars star Shane van Gisbergen has been added to the McLaren line-up and will race in Europe as a factory driver this season. <<|needle|>>His exact role is yet to be announced, but it is…Looking Back at the Beginning<image>10 Chinese Pole Dance Moves You Can Add To Your Routine\n\nIn this article, I cover all of the basics of Chinese pole dance (just Chines pole, really) and how you can incorporate some techniques into your own style of pole. <<|needle|>>You might find this education and insightful, the similarities, differences, and overall strategy a little bit surprising.\n\nI first saw Chinese Pole Dance on a stage in the Cirque du Soleil production, Saltimbanco, and it completely took my breath away.\n\nI was astonished by the acrobats’ effortless poise as they maneuvered nimbly up and down poles, performing death-defying stunts across a series of dizzying heights.\n\nI’ve wanted to learn to scale these giant circus poles ever since!\n\nChinese pole dance is a distinct style of pole dancing from the one you’re probably used to, although there are several apparent similarities. <<|needle|>>A lot of the postures and grips appear identical, and I was eager to discover how Chinese pole might broaden my pole dance arsenal by introducing new techniques.The biggest difference with Chinese pole is that while it still uses a metal pole, the pole is typically coated in rubber.\n\nThis gives the performer a considerable amount of extra grip and, as you can imagine, makes some poses a lot easier! However, this rubber pole pretty much rules out moves like spins.\n\nThe pole is wider, too, typically reaching 7-10cm (3-4″) in diameter. <<|needle|>>This makes a big difference when grasping the pole and also gives larger-handed or male acrobats a significant edge!\n\nThis means that the pole has a slight ‘give’ to it, and the extra swaying or looseness can be quite disconcerting when you first mount it!\n\nAs you know, after an intense session of pole dancing, your skin is sure to be tingling with excitement (well, that is another way to describe those delightful pole kisses we get!).\n\nYou will be happy to know; you still get these with Chinese pole. <<|needle|>>In fact, Chinese pole dance can be considerably less forgiving; any exposed skin is inclined to get burnt pretty quickly as friction heats it up when sliding down the pole… Ouch!\n\nBut it isn’t all bad; the rubber coating means you can get some extra grip through clothes, though complete protection is not always possible. <<|needle|>>(In fact, according to Wikipedia, Chinese pole artists use the burn marks left on their shoulders as a way to recognize each other. <<|needle|>>Sort of like a secret society handshake!)\n\nOne For The Men\n\nSimilar to mallakhamb, Chinese pole is normally performed by male acrobats. <<|needle|>>The reasons for this are likely to be historic or tradition in nature (i.e. <<|needle|>>men do it because men do it). <<|needle|>>Additionally, a man’s greater natural strength – and particularly upper body strength – is an advantage for many holds and poses.\n\nPerhaps the most famous Chinese pole pose (and yes, it’s a strength move and staple in the world of calisthenics and bar work) is the flag.\n\nCheck out this video of Dominic Lacasse, who holds a world record for the flag here. <<|needle|>>He manages to hold this pose for an insane 43.5s.\n\nMy first lesson with my instructor was a bit of a struggle, but it was also exciting. <<|needle|>>I learned ten poses, mostly transitions and rest postures, in addition to the usual Chinese climb. <<|needle|>>The majority of the moves work well on a dance pole, although some are more difficult owing to lower grip levels.The Chinese pole Climb places both feet flat on the pole. <<|needle|>>You tend to use more the ball of the foot pushing in. <<|needle|>>It’s important to keep the hips towards the pole and bent arms. <<|needle|>>The second you find yourself sinking back with straight arms it becomes very hard. <<|needle|>>I found this difficult at first as it was a very foreign way to climb the pole. <<|needle|>>(Plus I had completely the wrong shoes on!)\n\nThis climb is harder on a dance pole, but it’s great fun to do in bare feet or wearing a grippy pair of trainers. <<|needle|>>It’s an energetic and unusual way to start a routine, and can look particularly striking if you’re performing on a tall pole.\n\nInvert into the Gemini, but keep your free leg straight and dropping over your back, rather than sinking into the classic Gemini position.\n\nThen swing your free leg towards you, squeeze between your thighs, swing your torso around the pole, gripping the pole in your armpit, and finally change your leg to the Reverse Gemini. <<|needle|>>Then you can repeat the move again in the other direction.\n\nThe Gazelle is harder on a dance pole because of the lack of rubber, but it’s still very doable. <<|needle|>>Step through the move slowly at first, and remember to grip with your thighs. <<|needle|>>I also recommend using your hands on the pole to change sides at first.\n\nMake sure you start nice and high as the body does descend a little during this move, and be prepared to ignore the burn on your outside leg as you change position and ‘drop’ into the end pose – ouch!\n\nIf you’re precise enough, it’s a very dramatic way to do the Gemini over and over again in a routine, changing sides as you descend.\n\nThe Hip Lock is a variation on the Sit.\n\nWith the pole centered, twist the legs as though you’re going into the Barbed Wire, then lean forwards and round the pole to lock the pose.\n\nThe Hip Lock and Drop starts with a Hip Lock at the top of the pole. <<|needle|>>From there, slowly slide down by relaxing your body and allowing a little slip.\n\nAfter I’d done this, my instructor got me to speed it up. <<|needle|>>I went to the top, took a deep breath and released, and tightened again as the ground came rushing up to meet me. <<|needle|>>It took my breath away!Trending\nThe Best Chalk for Pole Dancing: Our Top 5 Picks\n\nI got a huge amount out of my first lesson, but it also made me realize just how much I still have to learn. <<|needle|>>And my goodness, I hurt the following day! I thought I was pole fit, but I now know just how hard I need to work at building up my core strength in particular. <<|needle|>>I felt like I had run a marathon!\n\nThe pole community has grown hugely in the past few years. <<|needle|>>Once upon a time, there were only about 60 or so known moves and spins. <<|needle|>>You only need to check sites like OpenDance Academy which lists hundreds of moves, for evidence of the explosion of creativity since pole first popped up as a desired hobby.\n\nBut there’s still huge unexplored potential, and a huge amount we can learn from Chinese pole in pole dancing. <<|needle|>>I hope to introduce it into my own teaching and routines soon and can’t wait for my next lesson!\n\nHave you used any of these (or other) Chinese pole moves in your pole routines?

This is an incredibly pivotal episode on one of the most storied shows in television history,\" Acho said in a statement.\n\nThe special, which will air on March 15 after the show's finale, will feature the show's lead Matt James and his final three picks: Bri, Michelle, and Rachael.\n\nThe host will discuss the finale's outcome and the current events surrounding the Bachelor franchise.\n\nIt appeared that current Extra correspondent Rachel Lindsay might have had some pull in Acho being asked to host.\n\nRachel Lindsay Said Acho Was Perfect For The Gig\n\nIn an interview with People Magazine, she said that Acho would be perfect to moderate what could turn out to be an authentic discussion about race and racism in American during the episode.\n\n\"For AFTR, Bryan and I both talked about this — we think Emmanuel Acho would be fantastic,\" Lindsay said.\n\n\"He is very outspoken about racial injustice, for social justice, and has pretty much been the person who said, 'I can have these uncomfortable conversations, and people trust it,'\" she explained of Acho's hiring.\n\nChris Harrison Stepped Down For The Season-Ender\"Who better to lead it?\" Lindsay continued. <<|needle|>>\"[He's] someone who's not involved with the franchise, no ties, no bias — I think it'd be great,\" Rachel concluded.\n\nAcho's hiring came on the heels of commentary made by Bachelor host Chris Harrison during an interview with Rachel for the television show Extra.\n\nDuring their discussion, Chris and Rachel agreed it would be best if Rachael spoke out about this topic herself. <<|needle|>>He agreed with Rachel that while the photos did not shine the best light on the contestant, he stood by his comments that over time, perspectives can change on certain things.During their talk, he said the contestant deserved \"compassion\" after social media posts surfaced where she was dressed as a Native American person and attending an antebellum plantation-themed ball.\n\nAfter receiving backlash for his remarks, the host announced on Instagram he would take a step back to \"try to evolve and be a better man.\" That announcement post can be viewed here.\n\nDuring the \"After the Final Rose\" episode, Acho, James, and the women will discuss issues that have been raised this season.I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. <<|needle|>>My usually jovial self will be taking a mental health day. <<|needle|>>Instead, I’ll be looking at everything in my life through a half empty glass. <<|needle|>>I’ll get over it, but my pissy mood wants to burn some bridges first.\n\nHaving successfully navigated my way through the harsh terrain of the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas, I finally made my way to the more civilized and well maintained New Vegas strip. <<|needle|>>People stumbled around drunk, gambling away their hard earned bottle caps while I cautiously scanned the area for danger. <<|needle|>>It was at that point that I was propositioned by a prostitute, a scantily clad but poorly modeled individual with the stereotypical prostitute name. <<|needle|>>Obviously, I abstained from partaking in the affair but I’m afraid similar scenarios give some of you erections. <<|needle|>>This article is for you.The pose, the nighty, the nausea\n\nIs it really that hard?\n\nI play video games because they allow me to do things I can’t feasibly do in real life. <<|needle|>>I won’t ever be an elite black ops soldier nor will I be able to cruise the galaxy solving crimes and hanging with aliens. <<|needle|>>Sex should be a very feasible activity thus its function in a video game confuses me. <<|needle|>>I’m sure one could argue for the necessity of game sex in reference to plot, emotional connection, etc but such an argument would make that person, well a bit creepy.\n\nThe flip side of that coin is some people are struggling to find sexual partners, thus validating the reliance on video games. <<|needle|>>I find that hard to swallow (heh,heh). <<|needle|>>First, there are people in the world of all races, body sizes and hygiene aptitudes that would like to have sexy time with a similar individual. <<|needle|>>Where do you think online dating came from? Not enough fantasy elements for you? Just put elf ears on a consenting person and have at it (keyword there is consenting).Perhaps the tactic is distract then stab?\n\nSexy game characters are turning into this generation’s Playboy centerfold, which freaks me out when you can literally buy magazines with REAL pictures of naked men and women in them. <<|needle|>>I went to pick up a copy of EGM and walked away empty handed because I was embarrassed. <<|needle|>>The cover, adorned with a curvaceous woman in very revealing body armor screamed to the other customers “I’m going home to masturbate!”. <<|needle|>>There were kids there and something about the situation felt illegal. <<|needle|>>Besides, such apparel sends a poor message to female warriors when the desire for sexiness outweighs the function of protective clothing.I have nothing to add, this picture is perfect.\n\nIn the past, low quality graphics made it impossible to convey sensuality through the screen, although I’m sure people got some funny business done with the help of Princess Toadstool in all her 8 bit glory. <<|needle|>>Today’s hardware does allow for the creation of believable character models and scenarios, so the next step should be focusing on supple breasts and photo realistic penetration right? My jump kick capabilities have increased tenfold over the past few years as well but that doesn’t mean I need to show them off at inappropriate times. <<|needle|>>That’s just boastful.\n\nI’m in no way discounting the work that’s gone into producing the buxom babes bouncing around the battlefield, I just don’t know if graphic artists realize the power they hold in controlling the world’s supply of nerd boners. <<|needle|>>If they did, maybe they’d tone it down. <<|needle|>>Or maybe its a deal between them and the keyboard manufacturers? Sticky keys and controllers can only function so long before a new ones need purchased. <<|needle|>>Freaking genius.The Medium is the Message | ITSLIQUID\n\nThe Medium is the Message<image>For our seventh edition, artists from home and abroad take you on a journey along 30 light artworks specially created for Amsterdam. <<|needle|>>The 53-day exhibition revolves around the theme “The Medium is the Message“, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist Marshall McLuhan. <<|needle|>>The role of light in conveying a message and the city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories are central to this edition.30 artworks and installations\nThe idea behind McLuhan’s statement was simple: the medium with which we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. <<|needle|>>What role does light play as a medium or as a message? More than 600 artists from around the world have looked into this issue and submitted their concept. <<|needle|>>Ultimately, 30 artworks were selected that will light up the historic city centre of Amsterdam during the festival.\n\n10 city stories\nThe rich history, unique architecture and extraordinary inhabitants of Amsterdam make the city as a medium very suitable for telling remarkable stories. <<|needle|>>On behalf of the festival, art historian and chief editor of the magazine Ons Amsterdam Koen Kleijn went in search of these stories and collected them in a ten-part series.Guest of honour: Jeroen Henneman\nThis year, the famous Amsterdam-based artist Jeroen Henneman is our guest of honour. <<|needle|>>Henneman, who is particularly known for his sculptures that look like “standing drawings”, develops especially for the festival two artworks and a ‘limited edition‘ will be for sale.\n\nEducation project: 30 classes, 30 premieres\nAlso this year, 850 pupils from 20 schools across Amsterdam are inspired by the theme. <<|needle|>>Under the guidance of Japanese artists Nagata and Monno they contribute to a work of art that is included in the exhibition. <<|needle|>>During the festival, every class enjoys its own exclusive premiere.\n\nVisit the exhibition\nFor 53 days, the exhibition can be admired by boat, by bike, or on foot. <<|needle|>>You can do

store in Nakano, Tokyo.\n\nYesterday, April 8th, Japanese mobile carriers have finally announced the release of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. <<|needle|>>This potent pair of products have been off the radar from all carriers with only Samsung itself having posted bare minimal PR information on its website. <<|needle|>>As if the consumer apathy isn’t apparent enough, Japan stands to receive arguably the most abridged line-up of all, while trying desperately to hide the fact that a Korean company, has made the product: Samsung’s name has been absolutely stripped from the device, front and back, right down to the promotional materials.\n\nTwo carriers will offer Samsung’s latest and greatest, but only one will carry both the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. <<|needle|>>Neither will sell a device in a 128GB storage option.\n\nSuffice to say, this lack of choice in storage size, coloring, and even standard design is a bit disappointing. <<|needle|>>All the more so given that docomo’s questionable parring of Edge color options are decidedly not to everyone’s liking.\n\nBoth carriers have removed all traces of the Samsung name, something which KDDI has done before but is new for docomo, which typically left the Samsung logo on the rear cover, despite reduced visibility. <<|needle|>>Let’s explore, beginning with the beginning:In the beginning… docomo wasn’t exactly trying to outright hide the fact that Samsung made the Galaxy S.\n\nIn truth, this is a rather puzzling reality that arguably began when NTT docomo released the original Galaxy S in November 2010: the Samsung logo wasn’t hidden but it was removed from the front entirely and moved to the lower half of the rear.While the front face contained the docomo logo as per most devices, the back cover offered Samsung’s as well, though pushed to the bottom.\n\nNow take a look at what had happen as of Summer 2014: no carrier logo at all on the front, and absolutely no Samsung logo period. <<|needle|>>From the KDDI au variant of the Galaxy S5:\n\nThe KDDI au Galaxy S5 line up: the first Samsung phone released in Japan without any carrier branding on the front whatsoever. <<|needle|>>The Samsung logo is also missing from the rear, as it was on the NTT docomo variant.\n\nCuriously the NTT docomo variant opted to keep the carrier logo on the front and left the Samsung logo on the back side, though it was extremely small.Now take a gander at the Galaxy S6 Edge. <<|needle|>>This next screen capture comes via Samsung UK’s product page:Samsung UK’s product page for the Galaxy S6 Edge. <<|needle|>>Note the prominent branding on the front and back of the device.\n\nAnd now Japan. <<|needle|>>Here is the front of the device with the KDDI au variant pictured. <<|needle|>>See the caption for details:<image>The front of the device is devoid of anything for KDDI au (pictured), but for NTT docomo will have the carrier’s logo under the earpiece.\n\nHere we have the rear side. <<|needle|>>I have specifically chosen the docomo variant as NTT had previously left Samsung’s logo, despite it being relegated to a lower positioning and smaller text. <<|needle|>>It is nowhere to be seen here, rather the word “Galaxy” is present. <<|needle|>>Bizarrely enough the Qi wireless charging logo appears.Here we have the backside, which contains not a mention of Samsung, yet has the word “Galaxy” and even the Qi logo.\n\nAs if this wasn’t odd enough, Samsung’s logo appears absolutely nowhere in NTT docomo’s 32-page product booklet for the S6 and S6 Edge. <<|needle|>>In fact, the company’s name doesn’t even appear until page 29 and 30, where it’s used for legal reasons. <<|needle|>>For all intents and purposes, “Galaxy” might as well be the manufacturer. <<|needle|>>This is indeed what Samsung appears to be doing however, as a customer representative from the company, Retsu Segawa, mentioned the desire to focus on the brand name when contacted earlier this year.Try as you might, not a single Samsung logo is anywhere in sight.\n\nBehind the scenes, there is the underlying pretense that Japan, as a collective, is unwilling to accept the fact that Korea has surpassed it in terms of mobile technology. <<|needle|>>This extends to the deployed network infrastructure, wherein Japan is just now getting Category 6 LTE, something that South Korea had almost a year ago.\n\nThis is absolutely shocking given that NTT docomo was the first carrier in the world to deploy 3G network infrastructure and for ages Japan’s feature phone market was light-years beyond anything the outside world could even comprehend: NFC was introduced over a decade ago, 1SEG wireless digital TV broadcasting had been a staple from around the same time, and Japan had access to full-featured mobile e-mail services whereas the world-at-large had to make due with SMS and MMS.\n\nArguably, there is not a single domestically produced piece of hardware that has specs comparable with Samsung’s Galaxy. <<|needle|>>This is especially true of display technology, where Korea has not only made significant use of OLED panels, but has for the past year been curving them. <<|needle|>>Meanwhile, companies like Sony continue to rely on LCD technology; at least Sharp has made some progress with the development of its IGZO display technology. <<|needle|>>Despite all this, we have the following:Fujitsu has a larger amount of market share than Samsung. <<|needle|>>Sharp arguably does as well. <<|needle|>>Sony has over double that. <<|needle|>>This jaw dropping astonishment is actually par-for-course in Japan, where it’s quite common to hear things like “I buy Sony because it’s Japanese.” Ironically even Japan’s patriotism doesn’t seem to hold much water when it comes to the iPhone however, with Apple once again dominating.\n\nSome might argue that Japan tends to prefer its own products, and is less receptive to brands from other countries. <<|needle|>>This is largely, if not entirely, based on the fact that as a collection of islands, it’s therefore isolated. <<|needle|>>While the people here may indeed love foreign things such as Hollywood movies, American TV shows, French food, German medical practices and so on, with technology things have been largely a domestic affair. <<|needle|>>Given the unrivaled dominance of companies like Sony, Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba, and NEC during the 80’s, 90’s and even part of the 00’s, this makes sense.\n\nWith that said, it is a bit frustrating to see the manner in which Samsung is being treated here. <<|needle|>>The company should be proud to offer such a fantastic product as the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, yet instead its being made to hide behind its own branding. <<|needle|>>Can’t we all just… get along?\n\nTagged:\nOpinions, Samsung, Samsung Galaxy S\nSamsungSamsung

education. <<|needle|>>A friend soon steered him to Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve (JRBP), Stanford University’s western-most 1,200 acres, located just a few hilltops away from his Atherton home.\n\nHe volunteered to become a docent and was soon back at school. <<|needle|>>Training requires<image>two Stanford biology courses taken over two quarters, focusing on ecology and ecological research, part classroom-based and part in the field. <<|needle|>>The classes have a mix of Stanford students and future docents. <<|needle|>>And while the students are transient, moving on after graduation, the community members form an ongoing pool of volunteers.\n\n“Serving as a docent is an opportunity to be outdoors in a stimulating environment, both physically and mentally,” Bill said. <<|needle|>>“At the same time, you’re learning and doing educational outreach. <<|needle|>>I’ve always enjoyed helping out with research projects. <<|needle|>>It’s the mix that’s really satisfying.”\n\nOver the years, Bill has worked on a research project on major climate change, focusing on how California grasslands respond. <<|needle|>>He’s also been involved in a study about the ecology of a plant called sticky monkey flower. <<|needle|>>“Studying it is a wonderful way to teach students how to approach ecological research,” he says.We joined Bill recently on a tour of Jasper Ridge, including an area called the Serpentine, known for its display of spring wildflowers. <<|needle|>>“This year, with all the rain, the grasses are shading out the flowers, making it not an ideal wildflower year.”\n\nHe pointed out the genetic diversity on the Ridge. <<|needle|>>Pink flowers called Linanthusparvilorus are on the northwest side of the Serpentine. <<|needle|>>Just a few yards away in sandstone soil, the flowers are white. <<|needle|>>“It was studying the Serpentine,” said Bill, “that Paul Erlich developed his theory of co-evolution.”\n\nJasper Ridge was named for a type of

those with incomes above $US99,000 (or $US136,500 if you file as a head of household) won't get a stimulus check. <<|needle|>>People who didn't file in 2019 will still be able to receive money based on their 2018 tax return. <<|needle|>>The IRS says that could happen within three weeks, as of April 2, 2020, writing, \"The distribution of economic impact payments will begin in the next three weeks and will be distributed automatically, with no action required for most people\".\n\nThe IRS expects to issue five million paper checks per week, Democrats said in their memo, adding that it would take 20 weeks to mail out all checks to eligible Americans.\n\nHowever, the Treasury on Wednesday reversed course, saying that senior citizens, Social Security recipients and railroad retirees who are not typically required to file tax returns will not need to file a tax return to get the payment. <<|needle|>>That means married couples filing joint returns will receive the full payment - $2,400 - if their adjusted gross income, which what you report on your taxes, is under $150,000.\n\nMost people should receive their money by mid-April via direct deposit, the Treasury said.\n\nThe money will be directly deposited in your bank account if the government has that information from your tax return.\n\n\"I told you it would be three weeks, now I'm telling you it will be two weeks\", Mnuchin said during a briefing at the White House on Thursday night.\n\nRecipients will receive these payments as a direct deposit or by paper check, just as they would normally receive their

U.S.Disney+Hotstar Is Now Live in IndiaCambodia: Beyond the temples of AngkorAs Cambodia emerges as a mainstream tourist destination, it’s time to look beyond Angkor and explore a few of the hidden gems\n\nAs home to the truly incredible Angkor Wat, it’s unsurprising that many tourists overlook the rest of Cambodia. <<|needle|>>But beyond the haunting ruins of Angkor Wat lie many beautiful, intriguing sights, as this article aims to give you a rundown on the hidden gems.\n\nYou haven’t seen Cambodia if you haven’t visited the historical museums of Phnom Penh that detail the country’s dark and difficult past. <<|needle|>>The bloody tales of Cambodia’s recent history are laid bare with bleak, profound clarity in the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. <<|needle|>>Between 1975 and 1979 the Khmer Rouge massacred nearly 3 million people (about 25% of the population) in the name of extreme Maoist agrarianism under Pol Pot.\n\nThe museum began life as an ordinary high school but was turned into Security Prison 21 in 1975. <<|needle|>>Photographs of the tortured bodies of prisoners are displayed in the same bloodstained rooms the liberating Vietnamese army found them in. <<|needle|>>Weapons and portrait photographs of the thousands of victims of this brutal revolution are also on show. <<|needle|>>This is a truly confronting experience, but one that is essential to understand contemporary Cambodia.\n\nAbout 17km (11 miles) away from Phnom Penh is the Choeung Ek Killing Field, the site of the prison’s extermination camp. <<|needle|>>The remains of almost 9,000 people have been exhumed from mass graves here and over 5,000 skulls are displayed in the Memorial Stupa. <<|needle|>>A visit to this site is another harrowing, sobering experience.<image>The sweeping beaches and forested mountains of Kampot province provide welcome relief from the hectic energy of Phnom Penh. <<|needle|>>Kep, Sabay and Nataya are all great spots for relaxing and unwinding. <<|needle|>>Bokor Hill Station in Preah Monivong National Park is a relic of the French colonial era; and its abandoned buildings include a hotel, casino and church. <<|needle|>>On clear days the view here stretches across the forest to the coast, while on cloudy days, mist swirls eerily around the station. <<|needle|>>Nearby, the two-tiered Popokvil Falls are a beautiful sight during the rainy season, however, please note that you cannot swim in the shallow pool.\n\nFor a coastal break, you may want to avoid the relatively developed Sihanoukville and head to Kep for spectacular sunsets, a rich history and some of the best seafood in Southeast Asia. <<|needle|>>Kep, originally an elite French resort, did not fare so well during the Khmer Rouge’s reign. <<|needle|>>The ruins of French colonial houses and villas are still scattered along the shoreline and may be explored at leisure. <<|needle|>>While Cambodians have been holidaying here for years, foreign tourists are still less prevalent.\n\nFor an idyllic beach experience, make the trip out to Koh Rong, an island located off the coast of Sihanoukville that’s made famous for lush coral reefs and sweeping sandy beaches. <<|needle|>>Koh Rong is accessible by ferry and has a small selection of bars for you to enjoy while lapping up the salt, sun and surf. <<|needle|>>If lying lazily in a hammock by the ocean is high on your list, Koh Rong is the place for you.The sleepy riverside town of Kratié (or Kracheh) is home to one of Cambodia’s main attractions to the north of Phnom Penh. <<|needle|>>Kratié is the best place in Cambodia to see endangered freshwater Irrawaddy dolphins and while thousands of these beautiful creatures used to swim in the Mekong, today, irresponsible fishing and pollution have driven the population down to as low as 80.\n\nThe town is defined by a large central marketplace, and it’s worth spending a day or two here in laid-back Kratié to soak up the faded colonial elegance while wandering along the riverfront and sampling local specialities from stalls. <<|needle|>>Depending on how squeamish you are, it might be wise to steer clear of one of the regional specialities, deep-fried spider.To really get off the beaten track, go trekking in the remote Ratanakiri province, one of Cambodia’s most diverse natural beauties. <<|needle|>>Expect lush, dense jungle, cascading waterfalls and remote ethnic minority villages in this unique snapshot of authentic Cambodia. <<|needle|>>The most famous landmark here is Lake Yeak Laom (aka Boeng Yeak Laom), where crystal clear waters fill the volcanic lake’s cavity and are superb for swimming.Home to some of the best food in Cambodia and with a balanced mix of eclectic, trendy boutiques and cafes amid the lush surrounding countryside, Battambang, a city on the Sangkae River, is a different Cambodia to the rest. <<|needle|>>Whether it’s the innovative blend of Khmer, French and Western cuisine that reels you in, the distinct lack of tourist traffic or the calmness created by an absence of local touts, Battambang should not be left off any alternative Cambodian itinerary.Kompong Luong, one of the most unique attractions in Cambodia, is a floating village complete with restaurants, schools, police stations, temples and karaoke bars, and home to 10,000 inhabitants and drifts on the southern edge of Tonlé Sap Lake. <<|needle|>>The exact location of the village depends on the season and currents and is a fantastic place to people-watch with a beer in a floating bar.For many tourists, Siem Reap represents nothing more than the gateway to Angkor Way and its magnificent ruins, however, it’s also home to some of Cambodia’s most sublime national parks and temples. <<|needle|>>Phnom Kulen National Park boasts magnificent cascading waterfalls and is a breathtaking insight into Cambodia’s mountain ranges. <<|needle|>>Here you’ll be able to find the relaxed ‘reclining Buddha’ at Preah Ang Thom protecting the area, as well as some of the best rainforest jungle in the country. <<|needle|>>Don’t miss this attraction in the wet season, as the surrounding waters are considered to be holy, with many locals of the opinion that they have medicinal qualities.<image>The former Soviet Union has a complicated history that is told in part through some of its deserted infrastructure. <<|needle|>>From mining towns to oil-rig cities, many of these structures, towns and areas were abandoned suddenly and thus provide a kind of snapshot of Soviet life frozen in time. <<|needle|>>Others tell stories of economic and political upheaval and even nuclear events. <<|needle|>>From oil rig cities and deserted industrial towns to dazzling island fortresses and once-luxurious estates of the Soviet elite here are seven more amazing Soviet abandonments. <<|needle|>>For more Soviet abandonments (from gruesome gulags to submarine bases) check out part one of this series.Abandoned Island Fortress: Fort Alexander sits abandoned on a man-made island off the shore of St. <<|needle|>>Petersburg. <<|needle|>>Constructed in the 1800s, the fort has over 100 cannon ports providing 360-degree defense. <<|needle|>>After the Crimean War it was initially used as a military storehouse before being converted by the Soviets into a dangerous plague research center due to its physical isolation from the mainland. <<|needle|>>The fort is now deserted and most of its interior objects have been stripped and metal has been melted down for other uses. <<|needle|>>Even now, however, visitors coming by boat (or snowmobile) are advised to wear a respirator and rubber boots.Abandoned Sea City: In 1949 the world changed forever as oil was struck for the first time in the sea off the coast of Azerbaijan. <<|needle|>>Before long the first oil platform was built around this site but that wasn’t all: dorms, schools, stores and other structures were all built up around this rig forming a virtual city on the water. <<|needle|>>Ships were brought out and sunk to form the basis of a series of man-made islands. <<|needle|>>Connected by a network of bridges and other structures this community has dwindled and is now all but deserted with buildings falling back into the sea.Abandoned Mine Complex: Unlike other Soviet mines in the Kyshtym region the ones in the photographs above at least aren’t radioactive. <<|needle|>>The ones shown here date back to the days of the Gulags and have been abandoned since the 1960s. <<|needle|>>A cooling tank explosion around that time contaminated almost 20 square miles around this and other local mines and caused the evacuation of nearly 300,000 residents. <<|needle|>>This incident was long hidden by the Soviet government before a scientist leaked the information in 1980. <<|needle|>>Other intrepid urban explorers, however, have braved even the nearby radioactive mines at their own risk.Abandoned Industrial Town: Pyramiden is a classic model Soviet small blue-collar coal-mining town with a long history that was quickly and suddenly snuffed out. <<|needle|>>In the early 1990s it was concluded that Pyramiden was no longer profitable and its citizens were given a few short hours to pack and leave. <<|needle|>>Much like Chernobyl the result has been sad but fascinating: virtually everything was left behind from house plants to books on library shelves. <<|needle|>>Though there are plans to potentially renovate this ghost town for now it provides a picture of local life two decades ago.Abandoned Soviet Estate: There are many abandoned estates scattered throughout Russia that are simply too remote to warrant restoration. <<|needle|>>As photographer Jason Grant points out, though, these are provide in many ways a more real experience of history for those who visit and photograph them. <<|needle|>>This particular estate in Belogorka survived the revolution and was only moderately damaged by a bomb in WWII. <<|needle|>>It was subsequently used as a scientific research institute and is now strewn with bottles and chemicals from these last tenants.<image>Abandoned Transportation: Throughout Russia and the former Soviet Union one can find a vast number of abandoned air, sea and land vehicles that have simply been left to rust rather than repurposed or recycled. <<|needle|>>In other parts of the world one would imagine they could find other uses for giant ships, disused fighter jets and entire train networks but here these things seem to fall through the cracks. <<|needle|>>Figures next to the planes and boats shown above bring home the enormous scale of these abandoned relics of Soviet transportation.Other Abandoned Areas: The region known as Abkhazia is a semi-independent zone within Georgia in which a great deal of transportation and other infrastructure has been deserted in recent decades due to a lack of funds. <<|needle|>>Shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union the region came into conflict with the rest of Georgia as Georgians pushed toward independence from Russia. <<|needle|>>Today, Russia issues passports for Abkhazians, pays their retirement pensions and provides citizenship to many of the people. <<|needle|>>Nonetheless, since the fall of the USSR the local budgets have not been enough to maintain many buildings and train networks as illustrated by the images above.Iris Garrigan has nothing.\n\nWell, that’s not entirely true. <<|needle|>>She has her trusty Doc Martin boots. <<|needle|>>She has her Bowie obsession. <<|needle|>>And she has the stray cat that sneaks into her bed and keeps her company at night – it’s a quid pro quo relationship. <<|needle|>>The cat gets a warm body and she gets something alive beside her when she would otherwise be alone.\nShe also has a job. <<|needle|>>Sure, washing dishes hardly has her rolling in dough, but with no permanent abode, it’s the best she can do. <<|needle|>>She knows her new boss only lets her work in his restaurant out of pity, but she isn’t above cashing in on a little human compassion if it means she can survive to live another day.\n\nEverything is going fine until Liam Cross starts to take notice of her, poking his newly minted police badge where it doesn’t belong. <<|needle|>>And if he doesn’t quit soon her not so legal living situation could find her in hot waters. <<|needle|>>Little does she know, Liam isn’t just being nosy, he’s trying to help. <<|needle|>>Iris has no idea that he’s been watching her for months, and that he’s completely enamored with her strange and peculiar ways.\n\nWhen Liam discovers her secret Iris has two options: stay and face the music or run for the hills.\n\n***Cross My Heart is a contemporary romance novella and tells the story of the youngest Cross brother, Liam Cross.***\n\nShort, and simple, but vibrant and full of unstoppable romance; L.H COSWAY style. <<|needle|>>Cross My Heart is one of those books that was made to conquer your heart, and you won’t even have a choice in the matter. <<|needle|>>By the time you are done reading it, your heart will feel happy and your soul will sing and dance to the tunes of David Bowie. <<|needle|>>I simply CAN’T GET ENOUGH of the Cross brothers.Iris works as a dishwasher at The Grub Hut, which is Lee Cross’s restaurant. <<|needle|>>She works hard to try to save enough money for a deposit to get her own apartment, and finally be able to stop living on the streets. <<|needle|>>Iris carries a lot of sadness, her mum died of a drug overdose when she was young, and Iris was forced into the foster care system until she reached eighteen, and ever since then she’s has had no place to live. <<|needle|>>Her best and only friend died in a gang related accident leaving Iris all alone in this world. <<|needle|>>But don’t think of Iris as a victim, she’s not! This girl is a fighter and a hard worker who doesn’t take crap from nobody.\n\nIris keeps to herself, she doesn’t socialize with anybody at work; her only friends are a stray cat that keeps following her everywhere, and the imaginary friend in the form of the spirit of David Bowie.Liam Cross changed his life around completely, he went from being a car thief to a police officer. <<|needle|>>Liam has been watching Iris closely, ever since she started working at his brother’ restaurant. <<|needle|>>He feels a pull towards her, Iris, the girl with deep sadness in her eyes and colorful skin.\n\nAt first, Liam offers Iris a friendship but he is very attracted to her and it won’t be long before these two surrender to the explosive attraction that takes over all their thoughts during the day and all their dreams at night.\n\nI loved this book, just like any other book that I’ve ever read by this author. <<|needle|>>She has a magic pen that creates amazing characters that will stay in our hearts forever. <<|needle|>>Cross My Heart being a novella, it felt like eating a small piece of your favorite chocolate, and I WANTED MORE!!!!!\nIn other words, I wanted this book to go on forever. <<|needle|>>What I’ll do is, I’ll re-read every single book in this series again, and hopefully that will quench my thirst for the Cross brothers.\n\nIf you haven’t tried this series, please do, it’s a TOTAL WINNER OF THE HEART.\n\nI have only read a few LH Cosway books but I am definitely a HUGE fan of hers! My goal this year is to try to ease up on my ARC requests and make some time to read all of this author’s previous books!! CROSS MY HEART was simply FABULOUS!! My only complaint was that it was written as a novella instead of a full-length standalone. <<|needle|>>I loved the Hero and Heroine. <<|needle|>>It would have been awesome if we got to spend more time with them but that being said, the story was still highly entertaining!!\n\nIris is a twenty-year-old young woman who has had a rough start in life. <<|needle|>>Her drug addict mom died when she was fourteen which resulted in Iris ending up in foster care. <<|needle|>>As soon as she turned eighteen she was no longer a ward of the state and she was left to fend for herself. <<|needle|>>Currently, she works as a dishwasher for Lee Cross at his restaurant, and she’s trying to save up enough money for a down payment on an apartment. <<|needle|>>The poor girl is homeless and only has some clothes and an old sleeping bag as her worldly possessions. <<|needle|>>She sleeps in an abandoned building and lives off of bread and peanut butter. <<|needle|>>Her only two friends are a little stray cat that sleeps with her at night and her imaginary friend who is the deceased David Bowie. <<|needle|>>I loved Iris completely!! Her imaginary conversations with Bowie were one of my favorite aspects of this story! Iris’ determination to not let her hardships destroy her also made me admire her immensely.Liam Cross is Lee’s younger brother who, in his youth, was a car thief, but now he’s turned his life around and he became a police officer. <<|needle|>>Since the day Iris started working in his brother’s restaurant, he has been intrigued by the beautiful girl with the sad eyes. <<|needle|>>Something about her has him feeling a fierce need to protect her. <<|needle|>>Iris has caught him staring at her on many occasions and on one hand, it freaks her out but also at the same time it excites her because she thinks Liam is just about the most beautiful man she’s ever seen.\n\nAfter Iris ends up nearly freezing to death one night when she loses her makeshift living quarters in an abandoned building, Lee offers her a room to rent in his house. <<|needle|>>His brother Stu has moved out and he offers his old room to Iris for a very minimal fee. <<|needle|>>Things heat up pretty quickly between Iris and Liam once they start living underneath the same roof. <<|needle|>>Although there is definitely the “insta-love” factor going on here, I still enjoyed this novella so much!! I hope that maybe LH might write another installment for this lovable couple.Coming soon (like, really soon) there will now be Disney stores INSIDE of select Target stores! The announcement was made at the recent D23 Convention in Anaheim, California, this past August. <<|needle|>>Keep reading for what we definitely know and for TOP SECRET insider info in regard to this historic and groundbreaking matchup!\n\nAt the biannual D23 Expo in Anaheim, California, Disney announced their new partnership with Target. <<|needle|>>The “shop-in-shop” concept is an exciting opportunity for lovers of both Target and Disney! According to Business Insider, select stores (see list below) will open on October 5, 2019 for the in-store shopping experience, while online shoppers get first dibs on October 4, 2019. <<|needle|>>However, other news outlets are reporting (i.e. <<|needle|>>The Wall Street Journal and The Miami Herald) that both the online and physical stores will launch simultaneously on October 4, 2019.\n\nAvailable items will include a myriad of Disney delights including Disney Princess, Star Wars, Marvel, Disney Junior characters, Classic Disney plush, apparel, home and holiday products, along with collectibles like the Disney Animators’ Collection. <<|needle|>>Stores will be managed and operated by Target employees. <<|needle|>>Online shoppers, click here to find everything your Disney heart desires. <<|needle|>>Or, visit Target.com/Disneystore when the clock strikes midnight (and mind your glass slipper)!\n\nThe first of the physical “shop-in-shop” Disney Stores/Target Stores, include the following locations:<image>Adding to the excitement, there will be another 40 “store-in-store” Disney/Target locations by the end of 2020. <<|needle|>>In 2021 Target will open a new retail location “near” Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL. <<|needle|>> Please, just take all of my money now.As a shopper, what can you expect to find in the new retail locations?\n\nAccording to Target, the Disney store at Target will feature more than 450 items including toys, games, apparel and accessories—with more than 100 products that were previously only available at Disney retail locations. <<|needle|>>The mini Disney stores will span about 750 square feet on average and will be located next to kids clothing and the existing toy aisles in Target stores. <<|needle|>>Prices will range from $2.00 – $200.00.\n\nAnd, did you know?\n\nPeople who own Disney gear or visit Disney theme parks are likely people who also shop at Target, according to Bob Chapek, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. <<|needle|>>He said there’s about a 90% overlap between the two company’s customers.\n\nNow that we have the facts – I’M ABOUT TO SPILL THE TEA!\n\nSo, I love Target, right? I mean, who doesn’t? I spend so much time at my local Target, I’ve actually made a few friends there, as in, actual employees of the company. <<|needle|>>So when this news dropped last month, I immediately hit up our local Target to check in with my peeps. <<|needle|>> At first, no one knew too much and there was a significant amount of speculation. <<|needle|>>Disney speculation coupled with Target tales are my favorite rumors to Google (which I did, of course). <<|needle|>>It turns out, even the Internet didn’t know too much about this new, brilliant partnership. <<|needle|>>I wasn’t able to find any information online.\n\n***Disclaimer: Most of the following information is speculation (albeit, incredibly reasonable and intelligent speculation,  but speculation nonetheless.)***\n\nNow, we’re a few weeks in and my Target friends (yes, they’re real people) have shared some amazing insider secrets with me. <<|needle|>>I took this information, threw it into a pot, mixed it with my own personal detective work, baked it in the oven for 45 minutes, and this is what I came up with:\n\n1). <<|needle|>>Some news outlets are reporting that the physical store inventory won’t be released until October 5, 2019. <<|needle|>>The employees of my local Target store are required to have everything shelved by October 3, 2019 (overnight). <<|needle|>>This leads me to believe that October 4, 2019 will be the grand reveal for both online and in-store shopping. <<|needle|>>You do not want to be late to this party! Plan for the 4th.\n\n2). <<|needle|>>Even though there are 25 “store-in-store” Disney/Target locations – additional stores are getting stocked with extra heavy Disney merchandise and Target/Disney merch exclusives – also dropping on October 4, 2019. <<|needle|>> My local Target store has everything in stock and ready to be displayed BUT, this is not the case for EVERY Target store. <<|needle|>>As an example: I am situated about 30 – 45 minutes away from 4 Target stores and one high-end Target. <<|needle|>>Out of the 4 Target stores and the high-end Target, only ONE of these is getting the “extra” Disney merchandise (but, remember, it’s not an official “store-in-store” location) and it’s my local Target (not the really fancy one). <<|needle|>>I don’t know how this location was identified to carry the additional (special) Disney/Target merch. <<|needle|>>But, if I were to guess the rationale would, most likely, fall somewhere between its exceptionally rural location and sales data.\n\n3). <<|needle|>>My local Target store currently has an end cap of Haunted Mansion merch – including tees, Funko large and small figures (as of blog publication, not available at Target.com), and two Loungefly bags. <<|needle|>>Just seeing the new Loungefly labels at Target should be a really good indication as to what is coming next! It should also be noted that the Haunted Mansion merch and end cap display was only available in 1 out of the 5 aforementioned brick and mortar Target stores. <<|needle|>>The Loungefly bags are available at Target.com but the other Haunted Mansion items are not showing online at all (at the time of publication).4). <<|needle|>>I actually got see a sneak peak of just some of the new Disney merch coming to my local Target store and, I can honestly say, all of my Target/Disney tribe will be very, very happy on October 4, 2019.\n\nI am so excited for this new Disney/Target colab! I can’t wait to see all of the magical and exciting things that are coming our way! Now that I’ve spilled the tea, it’s your turn! Have you heard anything? Do you have Target friends too? What are they saying? Tell us what’s happening in the comments!\n\nYou’ve got a friend in me!\nSincerely, Auntie BriMumbai, Mar 12: Days after Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the Congress amid a rebellion in Madhya Pradesh by his supporters, the Shiv Sena said the Uddhav Thackeray-led government in Maharashtra is \"strong and impregnable\".\n\nAn editorial in Sena mouthpiece ''Saamana'' on Thursday also criticised the Congress for neglecting the aspirations of its youth leaders.\n\nIt also said the BJP in Maharashtra should stop \"daydreaming\", and remember that just like the unexpected political drama in the western state a few months ago, a \"shock experiment\" can take place in Madhya Pradesh.<image>He joined the BJP on Wednesday and slammed the Congress for \"denying reality\" and \"not acknowledging\" new thoughts and new leadership. <<|needle|>>He has also been named as BJP''s Rajya Sabha candidate from Madhya Pradesh.\n\nCommenting on these political developments, the Shiv Sena criticised the Congress for neglecting the aspirations of its youth leaders, saying even though Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh are at the \"helm\" of the Madhya Pradesh Congress, it was not necessary to completely sideline a leader like Scindia.Hitting out at the BJP, it said during the Lok Sabha elections last year, the saffron party used its full mightto defeat Scindia, but now it has welcomed him into its fold with \"open arms\".\"Kamal Nath is also a shrewd and daring politician and will not give up easily. <<|needle|>>Just like the unexpected political drama in Maharashtra, a shock experiment can take place in Madhya Pradesh,\" the Marathi daily said.\n\nIt further said the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government is \"stong and impregnable\". <<|needle|>>\"There is no room for even a rogue ant to go out or come in,\" it said.\n\nThe Congress lost the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh under the leadership of Ashok Gehlot and Kamal Nath, respectively, the Sena pointed out.\n\n\"When seniors fail, the young leadership should be encouraged. <<|needle|>>This is not happening and that is why (Rajasthan deputy chief minister) Sachin Pilot and Gehlot are at loggerheads. <<|needle|>>If the matter is not resolved, it is believed that Rajasthan may go the Madhya Pradesh way,\" it claimed.\n\nIt noted that eight months ago, Scindia criticised the BJP, calling it a \"murderer of democracy\" after the Congress- JD(S) coalition government in Karnataka was toppled.\n\n\"Fifteen days ago, he criticised BJP leaders for making hate speeches and now after joining the BJP, he says Congress is not the party it used to be earlier,\" it said.\n\n\"What were Scindia''s demands - the state (Madhya Pradesh) unit president''s post or the Rajya sabha ticket? Both were denied to him. <<|needle|>>If at least one demand was accepted, this situation wouldn''t have arisen,\" the Shiv Sena said.\n\nStory first published: Thursday, March 12, 2020, 11:39 [IST]\nOther articles published on Mar 12, 2020\nFeatured Posts\nFor Daily Alerts\nNotification Settings X\nTime Settings\nClear My notification inbox\nDone\nClear Notification X\nDo you want to clear all the notifications from your inbox?\nYes No\nSettings X\n0\nNo New Notifications\nX\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website. <<|needle|>>This includes cookies from third party social media websites and ad networks. <<|needle|>>Such third party cookies may track your use on Oneindia sites for better rendering. <<|needle|>>Our partners use cookies to ensure we show you advertising that is relevant to you. <<|needle|>>If you continue without changing your settings, we'll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on Oneindia website. <<|needle|>>However, you can change your cookie settings at any time. <<|needle|>>Learn more\nChange Settings ContinueTake that, Evangelicals! Pope Francis accepts the big bang and evolution of science - not the intelligent design of creationists - as he declares god is not a magician with a magic wand.\n\nAs much interesting Big bang sounds, it is also unproven just like God. <<|needle|>>Also a lot of so called scientific research coming out are flawed to favour particular set of people.\n\nObserving the rise of radical wokism, I see it no different than religions.\n\n@Petter Yes it should be called, mere theory, lifestyle, etc. <<|needle|>>But that's not the point here. <<|needle|>>Though religion used to play a negative role at certain time, but now I see wokism & communism as present day facist & fundamentalist cult where there is no place for unbelievers.\n\nEven though I'm an atheist, but these days I see Western conservatives making more sense than wokes on most of the issues except their claims for god & christianity. <<|needle|>>I guess you know that a lot of skeptics/atheists/progressives are in conservative/right wing bloc now despite having some disagreements.\n\nI see that problem has never been religion, but pervert minded & selfish humans.\n\nThe link takes me to another article. <<|needle|>>The title: Vaughan faces test of nerve in 'English sport's toughest job' Now, I don't like US sports including football. <<|needle|>>I don't think any more highly of English sports. <<|needle|>>They may be worse, I don't understand Cricket so I can't be sure.\n\nhmm, and i thot big bang=intelligent design all this time lolWell there is an entire sect of the Catholic church known as the Jesuits who are very much scientific.I know. <<|needle|>>They have had some acrimonious disaccords with the mainstream church over the centuries.\n\nModern Catholicism is generally far more compatible with science, while modern Creationists are stuck in pseudo-science. <<|needle|>>You can always find conflicting ideas among Catholic theologians, but Catholic universities typically teach Darwinian evolution in their biology departments.\n\n\"Catholic schools in the United States and other countries teach evolution as part of their science curriculum. <<|needle|>>They teach the fact that evolution occurs and the modern evolutionary synthesis, which is the scientific theory that explains how evolution proceeds.\"\n[en.wikipedia.org]\n\nYikes, i wonder how the religious in the American South will react to that. <<|needle|>>They arent exactly following the pope...Nor are they generally Catholic. <<|needle|>>Southern Bapist is the majority denomination.\n\nEvangelical: \"So the Pope is now in league with Satan? I saw that coming years ago.\"\n\nYep, the No True Scotsman fallacy.\n\nMany Evangelicals declare that Catholics are not even Christian. <<|needle|>>LOL\n\nIt's duplicitous for the church to seek credence by resurrecting arguments which refute it.\n\nNot quite. <<|needle|>>It's still the god of the gaps... <<|needle|>>(quoting) \"Francis explained that both scientific theories were not incompatible with the existence of a creator – arguing instead that they “require it”.\"\n\nObviously the Pope knows next to nothing about what he now claims to believe. <<|needle|>>Which is to say he is lying through his teeth, supposedly to reduce the hatred of science within his sheep.\n\nEvolution is absolutely incompatible with Christian dogma for disproving The Fall and thus the need for Jesus. <<|needle|>>The Big Bang is similarly wholly at odds with Genesis.\n\nWrong. <<|needle|>>Catholics view the Bible allegorically, to one degree or another, not literally.\n\n@Storm1752 Was Jesus allegorical? And Moses? And when Jesus mentioned Adam in the same passage with Moses, one was allegorical and the other not, or both were? Or one picks and chooses what to believe? Is that what they mean when they talk about a cafeteria catholic? Kind of confusing for absolute Truth...\n\nWTF? That's clickbait. <<|needle|>>I'm expecting to hear the Pope endorse science, instead it's a article about the stupidest sport in the world.Pearl has the correct link at the bottom of this page for the seven year old news.\n\nSpeaking of a golden oldie:\n\nYea verily I say unto thee he who is without baseball should throw the first rock at that other stick-rock game.\n\n@waitingforgodo They have cricket clubs in the states. <<|needle|>>My dad kept a cricket bat in his car for protection. <<|needle|>>Baseball bat works better. <<|needle|>>I saw nothing about the Pope.\n\n@barjoe then bless ed art thou amongst bartenders and bless ed is the fruit in the cocktail of thy contributions here at tea in the cricket and in all the games we enjoy like those american ones which are pretty good but can't hold a roman candle to a game that lasts five days without a fresult..\n\nI agree that test cricket can drag a bit but compared to American football and baseball it is quite exciting.\n\n@Moravian, @waitingforgodo What does the link have to do with Pope Francis and the Big Bang Theory? Excuse me for actually reading the link, or at least making an attempt.\n\nAs far as Popes go, this one is much better than most.As far as popes go isn't up.\n\nI told you Catholic are different. <<|needle|>>Not infallible, and I doubt even the pope believes that.\n\nDon't Evangelicals already think of the Catholic church as the Great Whore of Revelations? This would just be another bit of confirmation of it.\n\nYes, they do. <<|needle|>>I saw a story that said a large number of Evan Priests are realizing their culpability in creating treason and changing their sermons to a kinder, gentler, version of gospel. <<|needle|>>They claim the flock has been getting the wrong message so it's their fault.\n\nAlways suspected that Frank is a closet atheist.\n\nYou can include a link to this post in your posts and comments by including the text q:578672\nAgnostic does not evaluate or guarantee the accuracy of any content. <<|needle|>>Read full disclaimer.Arsenal have rejected a formal offer for Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona and vowed not to begin negotiations with the Spanish champions.\n\nBarca made a bid of just over £29million on Tuesday night, but their first official approach met with a blunt refusal from Arsenal.\n\nThe Barclays Premier League side went on to issue a strongly-worded statement on Wednesday afternoon, insisting they have 'no intention' of selling the 23-year-old midfielder.<image>The statement read: 'Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas is under contract with the club until the summer of 2015. <<|needle|>>He is a highly valued member of the team and part of our future plans.\n\n'We have followed recent speculation linking Cesc with a move away from the club but as there has never been any official approach for him, only two informal exchanges, in which we made it abundantly clear that we have no interest in transferring Cesc, we have refrained from passing comment.\n\n'However, on Tuesday evening we received an offer from Barcelona for Cesc and in response, we immediately and resolutely told them once again that we have no intention of selling our captain.\n\n'To be clear, we will not make any kind of counter-proposal or enter into any discussion. <<|needle|>>Barcelona have publicly stated that they will respect our position and we expect that they will keep their word.'But in Barcelona, the club's hierarchy remained confident of signing Fabregas, who is fit to play for Spain in their final World Cup warm-up match against South Korea in Innsbruck this afternoon.Talk the talk: Barcelona players, like Carlos Puyol (left), have publicly backed the move for Fabregas, much to Arsenal's displeasure\n\nThe midfielder has not played since cracking the fibula in his right leg in the first leg of Arsenal's Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona on March 31.\n\nBarca vice-president Rafael Yuste told the club's official website: 'I'm hopeful he can sign for the club as soon as possible.\n\n'I'm optimistic and it is clear that he, his family, the players and the entire environment would give a very warm welcome.\n\n'So we will not do anything to thwart his signing. <<|needle|>>We will not be in any kind of hurry, but we will not pause either. <<|needle|>>The ball is in Arsenal's court and, as we have an exceptional relationship with them, I am optimistic.'\n\nBarcelona director general Joan Oliver added: 'Everyone knows that Cesc wants to play for this club and everyone knows we also want this.\n\nBut there is a third major player, which is Arsenal. <<|needle|>>Any deal must go through them and June 1 was the beginning of the period of official negotiations.'\n\nAnother Premier League midfielder was also the centre of attention in Spain on Wednesday. <<|needle|>>Steven Gerrard could be seen in the shirt of Real Madrid just 48 hours after Jose Mourinho claimed the club would not be making the big news in the transfer market this summer.\n\nFortunately for Liverpool fans, it was a mock photo of Gerrard in Madrid daily paper Marca who dedicated a full page to how the England star would look wearing Real Madrid's colours as they linked him with a move to the Bernabeu.\n\nThe paper claimed while Real would not be spending the millions they spent last summer, they was considering testing Liverpool's resolve regarding Gerrard, 30.Trending\nYou are at:Home»The Explorer»Spas»Spa of the Month: Lord’s Palace Resort & Spa, Kyrenia\nBy Anna Selby on June 22, 2022 Spas\n\nNow this is what I’d call a party spa. <<|needle|>>A contradiction in terms? After all, aren’t spas supposed to be restful, tranquil places with tinkly music and hushed voices? Well, to be fair, the spa at Lord’s Palace is exactly that but it’s in a setting where a lot more is going on.\n\nThe setting is, in fact, the north shore of North Cyprus. <<|needle|>>This is the Turkish part of the island and it shares with Turkey a love of glamour and bling. <<|needle|>>So, to start with my room: it is, of course, vast. <<|needle|>>There is a television the size of a billiard table (well, nearly) and beneath it a fake flame fire – which seems odd in a hot country but it gives a curiously pleasing glow, especially at night. <<|needle|>>There is a lot of black glass and marble, especially in the bathroom, where there is also a female life-size statue to welcome you into another vast space. <<|needle|>>On the bed is a pillow decorated with the Lord’s Palace crown logo and my name embroidered beneath. <<|needle|>>Excess? I’ll say. <<|needle|>>But, in these straitened times, you grab your treats when you can.And this is a great place for a party. <<|needle|>>There are two enormous pools, side by side, and surrounded by loungers, cabanas and double basket chairs. <<|needle|>>There are more pools dotted around the extensive, manicured grounds. <<|needle|>>Then there is a huge outdoor club – not quite finished when I was there but you could see it was going to be quite something. <<|needle|>>Sitting on the harbour wall and looking back over the water to the town of Kyrenia, its walls are tastefully Gothic, arched and crumbling – a homage to the magnificent medieval Bellapais Abbey (20 minutes away and the one bit of sight-seeing you really do need to do while you’re there).\n\nThe party continues on the top floor of the main hotel where there is an outdoor pool on the roof, indoor/outdoor dining and a DJ three nights a week. <<|needle|>>This is one of three “extra” restaurants dotted around the place – they aren’t included in the full board package which is based around a main restaurant serving an excellent extensive buffet three times a day. <<|needle|>>Then there’s the shisha lounge – and did I mention the in-house casino?So, lots of entertainment but there’s also a chance to chill. <<|needle|>>As well as the cabanas around the pool, there are the very superior cabanas down by the harbour. <<|needle|>>There are steps down to the water (either waist high or chest high depending on the tide) – crystal clear down to the golden sand below. <<|needle|>>These cabanas are big enough for six people. <<|needle|>>There are loungers (single and double) next to them if you want to sunbathe or, if you prefer the shade, you can lie on the white towelling cushions and watch the boats go by. <<|needle|>>There’s ice for your water (and any other drinks you fancy), food is delivered and a huge fruit platter comes as a matter of course. <<|needle|>>And, while I know we don’t really talk about prices at the Arbuturian, I do have to say that this is quite a steal given the current exchange rate with the Turkish lira (used in North Cyprus), so the whole day here will cost you less than £50.\n\nYou can see where I’m going with this party theme then. <<|needle|>>For a bunch of friends in need of sun and R&R, I can’t think of anything better. <<|needle|>>It would surely be the ideal hen party destination. <<|needle|>>Especially, of course, as it has a spa.The spa is even more darkly glamorous than my room – all dark marble, glass and flickering candles. <<|needle|>>I have decided to go (at least for the first hour) the traditional hamam route – this is Turkish Cyprus, after all – and I’m led by my therapist Doungjai first to a room with two massage tables and several doors. <<|needle|>>One leads to a shower, another to a sauna and the third to a private hamam. <<|needle|>>There is a bigger one if you want to do this with friends but, for now, all of this is mine!\n\nSo, I start in the obligatory big paper pants and wrapped in a very thin blanket in the sauna. <<|needle|>>This is the first part of the process to speed up the sweating process and open the pores. <<|needle|>>If you were in a public hamam (and there is a 16th century one in the capital, Nicosia, if you want to try) you would sit and roast for a long time in the heat before you were taken for your peel and foam massage. <<|needle|>>Here, you’re already gently cooked and ready to get started.Unlike the rest of the spa, the hamam is pale marble, its surfaces are heated (including the table you lie on) and there are brass taps constantly pouring hot water into bowls in the steamy atmosphere. <<|needle|>>I lay on my thin blanket from the sauna and we begin. <<|needle|>>The peel here is nothing to do with chemicals, it’s not even a salt-based scrub. <<|needle|>>Quite simply, it’s a mitt. <<|needle|>>The peel begins with the face and, for someone with quite sensitive, flaky skin like me, this is a bit alarming. <<|needle|>>However, it’s a very gentle scrub and afterwards the result is smooth and polished – any roughness disappears which is slightly counter-intuitive but impressed me!\n\nFrom here, the peel continues over the whole body but a bit more vigorously. <<|needle|>>This not only means that you get rid of dead skin, it stimulates the circulation and the lymph (your armpits, for instance, are given a thorough scrub), invigorating several systems at once. <<|needle|>>After all this, there will be no hard skin left on your feet (a lot of attention is paid to your feet throughout, in fact) and you will be glowing rosily.<image>The skin thus prepped, we go on to the foam. <<|needle|>>Now the foam is, let’s face it, soap – again, a bit of a concern for someone with sensitive skin. <<|needle|>>(I have to say, though, that somehow this does not act in my experience as an irritant.) The foam is produced by swinging a large pillowcase soaked in the soapy water so it turns into a quivering layer of bubbles several inches in depth and laid across every bit of you except the face. <<|needle|>>No, I don’t get it either but that’s how it works. <<|needle|>>The foam is then massaged in – and I do mean a full-on massage here – to every bit. <<|needle|>>This includes the face but it goes much further. <<|needle|>>Imagine you’re a baby and someone cleans inside your ears, in between your toes. <<|needle|>>Your hair is washed (very thoroughly with two shampoos and conditioning) and there is a long, deep scalp massage. <<|needle|>>In the heat and with the relaxing effects of the deep massage, you become passive, languorous, somnolent.\n\nUntil the rude awakening when you’re sluiced down with bucket after bucket of water including, once you’re sitting up, over your head. <<|needle|>>Just remember to keep your eyes shut! The water gets gradually cooler to close your pores and bring your body temperature back to normal. <<|needle|>>Then you’re dried like a baby (in between the toes again as one slipper after the other is put on your feet), wrapped in a dressing gown and taken to recover. <<|needle|>>At this point, plates of nuts, fresh fruit and dried fruit, and a smoothie arrive.Then after 10 minutes of relaxation, it’s time for my massage (my second massage effectively). <<|needle|>>This is a mixture of aromatherapy and Balinese – like my therapist Doungjai. <<|needle|>>There’s a long list of massages on the spa menu but this one begins with that cat-like tread beloved of eastern massages easing out the muscles while you’re still under your towel. <<|needle|>>Then it works its way around the body, a combination of gentle oily effleurage and manipulation of the joints – my feet are flexed, my legs bent back so my calves touch my thighs, even my hands and fingers get a workout. <<|needle|>>We finish with a blissful face and scalp massage.\n\nThe spa, like everything else here from the top-hatted, tail-coated doorman, Alex, to the service throughout the resort, is definitely 5* with plenty if bling but simultaneously pretty laidback. <<|needle|>>I can’t think of a better place for a party.\n\nYou can get to Lord’s Palace either via Ercin airport in North Cyprus (with Turkish Airlines) or from Larnaca in South Cyprus where you have a wider choice of airlines. <<|needle|>>The hotel arranges transfers from both airports. <<|needle|>>For more information, including details of treatments, please visit www.lordspalace.com.Mr Redmayne, an award-winning actor who is known for his performance in The Theory of Everything and the Fantastic Beasts series, has rubbed shoulders with royalty on several occasions. <<|needle|>>He went to Eton College, the elite school near Windsor Castle where both Prince William and Prince Harry studied for their GCSEs and A-levels, which is thought to be one of the most expensive schools in the UK. <<|needle|>>The actor was in the same year as the Duke of Cambridge — they have just a five-month age gap between them, and even played on the same rugby team.\n\nAs a guest on ‘Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen’, Mr Redmayne explained what it was like to be one of the future monarch’s peers.\n\nHe said: “I did play rugby with Prince William…\n\n“I always felt a bit sorry for him, because basically any school you played, all they wanted to do was tackle Prince William and they could say, ‘I tackled Prince William’.\n\n“So if you were standing next to Prince William, like I was, it was actually quite easy and quite fun.”\n\nThey are thought to have played together on the Colts B rugby team in 1997.\n\nHe told the US TV host that William ended up taking all of the “hits” when they were playing together.Mr Redmayne said: “He took all the hits. <<|needle|>>I haven’t seen him since school, but he was a lovely man.”\n\nAlthough the actor said he had not seen William since they left Eton in 2000, they were actually photographed together in July 2015 at the Cambridge County Polo Club.\n\nAccording to PEOPLE magazine, the royal and the actor were also part of a group called ‘Pop’, during their time at the Berkshire college.\n\nAlternatively known as the ‘Elite Eton Society’, this group is reserved for prefects and is still considered a networking tool for previous members today.Mr Redmayne also met with another member of the Royal Family, the Queen, in 2016 — when he received an OBE award from the monarch for his contributions to acting.\n\nHowever, he downplayed his achievements when talking to Mr Cohen.\n\nThe actor recalled: “You go to Windsor Castle, you queue up alongside the most extraordinary people who have genuinely done brilliant things, and you’re an actor and you feel a bit of a schmuck.\n\n“You go through a door to meet the Queen, and in that room is this huge assembly room of people, it’s royal and palatial and there’s a string quartet playing music.\n\n“I suddenly heard them playing Coldplay!”He added that the Queen is “so cool” and claimed: “I don’t remember her being small, but I was pretty nervous.”\n\nHe was also asked if he had been invited to Prince Harry’s nuptials — which took place the same year as Mr Redmayne’s interview — although he confirmed he did not make the guest list.\n\nHarry is two years younger than both Mr Redmayne and William, meaning it’s unlikely they would have been able to spend much time together at school.<image>William and Mr Redmayne both went on to study History of Art at university after Eton — although the second-in-line to the throne later switched to Geography during his time at the University of St Andrews, while his peer spent three years studying History of Art at Cambridge.\n\nSeveral of William’s close friends are thought to be Eton alumni too.\n\nHis former classmate James Meade was reportedly an usher at the Cambridges’ wedding, while his school friend Harry Aubrey-Fletcher was chosen to be Prince Louis’ godfather in 2018.Android updates arrive when they arrive, and that if they arrive. <<|needle|>>The good news is that in recent months several brands have announced that extend support for Android and security updates of at least some of their mobiles.\n\nIf you have lost track of who offers what, here we collect the most current information about how many years of updates each manufacturer promises and the fine print behind each of these statements.If Android updates are an important factor for you when choosing a mobile, few options are better than getting a Google Pixel. <<|needle|>>Mainly because updates arrive before any other mobile, no need to wait. <<|needle|>>In addition, they are already released with the latest version of Android pre-installed at the moment.\n\nSamsung was one of the first companies to break the spear in favor of bringing Android updates over the usual two years. <<|needle|>>The company has announced that they will receive three years of Android updates The Galaxy S, Galaxy Note, Galaxy Z, Galaxy Tab S, and some recently released Galaxy A’s. <<|needle|>>You can see the list here.\n\nWith a huge mobile catalog, the implicit rule is that the mid-high and high-end terminals will receive three years of updates; the rest two. <<|needle|>>The most basic terminals generally receive one or sometimes none.\n\nRegarding the security updatesSamsung raises the stakes to four years of updates for various terminals, which can reach up to five years for its terminals launched under the business program.\n\nOnePlus was encouraged to take the step of increasing update support for a year more recently. <<|needle|>>In this way, the company guarantees three years of Android updates for your most powerful terminals. <<|needle|>>The mid-range stays in the two years of a lifetime.\n\nAndroid updates on OnePlus go three gears. <<|needle|>>The high-end will receive three years of updates, the mid-range OnePlus Nord will have two, and the most basic models such as the OnePlus N10 and N100 will have a single year of updates. <<|needle|>>Security updates last for three four years on the high-end and three on the rest.OPPO tried to join the trend of offering longer support for security updates, although the truth is that today the promise falls a bit short. <<|needle|>>The last thing the company has communicated is that the OPPO Find X series will have two years of Android and three security updates.\n\nThe only ray of hope is that OPPO claimed to be studying add an additional year, although at the moment we have not had more news about it. <<|needle|>>Few changes therefore with respect to the unwritten rule of two years of updates that has been with us in Android for years.\n\nFor the rest of the terminals there are no fixed rules, so it applies the general rule. <<|needle|>>The most powerful should receive two years of updates, which will be reduced to one or none as it is lowered to the mid-range and entry.Vivo itself has taken a step beyond the usual two years, after announcing that the most powerful models of the brand, the X series, would receive up to three years of Android and security updates, for the new models launched from this year.\n\nFor the rest of series there are no rules written in stone, so it will depend on each case. <<|needle|>>The normal thing will be to think that the upper-middle-range terminals receive two years and updates and those that are cheaper have one or none.Android One has a large presence in the Nokia catalog, which is generally one of the first to announce update plans for each new version of Android. <<|needle|>>Even with so much organization, the unwritten rule of two years of updates still applied, with the advantage that some of its cheapest terminals they also keep updating. <<|needle|>>The Nokia 1 launched with Android 8.1 Go and has been updated to Android 10 Go.\n\nRecently, Nokia announced that it guaranteed three years of Android and system updates, although only for the Nokia X10 and X20. <<|needle|>>Without more news about other terminals, it is to be assumed that the rest of the catalog is maintained in the two years of updates and of the system, unless further notice.Xiaomi has always prioritized the MIUI version over the Android version, so trying to find the logic behind the update policy guarantees a good headache. <<|needle|>>However, he surprised us recently with the promise of three years of updates and four of security, although only for Xiaomi 11T models, at the moment.LG officially exited the mobile business, but still with stock and recently launched high-end handsets, the company decided to calm things down by announcing support for up to three years of Android updates for some of its terminals.\n\nThis extended support applies to the most premium LG phones, including the series LG G, LG V, LG Velvet y LG Wing that have been released as of 2019. <<|needle|>>Other terminals are governed by the common rule of two years of updates.<image>Previous manufacturers have announced their plans to extend Android or security updates beyond the norm, while other brands have not yet spoken, such as Huawei, Honor, Sony or Motorola.\n\nUntil further notice, in these cases the usual thing is that its most cutting-edge models receive two years Android updates, which will drop to one or none in the mid and entry ranges, albeit without any promise.There will be well over 2,000 voters participating in today's election.\n\nWell, maybe “swarming” is overstating it, but several reporters were in town trying to find monitors from the Justice Department who are in town to observe the election. <<|needle|>>The DOJ announced a week ago that it would send in agents to make sure voters’ rights were protected and that no one is discriminated against.\n\nBut according to Hamtramck Deputy City Clerk August Gitschlag, that’s not really the case. <<|needle|>>Instead, he said, the department is here to make sure the city has complied with a new law requiring cities where there are a significant number of foreign-speaking voters to post election law and directions in their language.\n\nHamtramck has a sizeable Bangladeshi community as well as Yemeni and Polish and even Bosnian.\n\nHamtramck has been and continues to comply with the law.\n\n“It has nothing to do with the Susan Dunn thing,” Gitschlag said.\n\nThe reference of Dunn is to the 1999 election when Dunn, who happens to be running for city council in this election, and a group of others challenged the voting rights of over 40 voters.\n\nIn an ironic twist, the group officially called themselves “Concerned Citizens for a Better Hamtramck.”\n\nWhat they did in that election was anything but “better” for the city’s image.City council candidate Susan Dunn found herself in the ironic position of seeking the support of voters she tried to prevent from voting in 1999.\n\nUnfortunately, the group targeted mostly Bangladeshi and Arabic voters, making them swear that they were citizens and were qualified to vote.\n\nTrouble is, the group didn’t have any background knowledge of the individual voters and just randomly challenged voters.\n\nTo some, it seemed like a scene from 1950s-era Mississippi where black voters were the target.\n\nDunn and another member of Concerned Citizens were eventually charged and convicted of harassing voters, which was only a misdemeanor.\n\nThere have been no other incidents of voter intimidation since then, but the Justice Department hung around for several years to monitor Hamtramck elections, you know, just in case.\n\nAs for voter turnout, it looks like it will be high. <<|needle|>>Gitschlag said that as of 3 p.m., the turnout was about the same as the primary election held in August. <<|needle|>>In that election, 2,100 voters participated – an unheard of number for an election for only city offices.\n\nMore incredible has been the high number of absentee ballots submitted. <<|needle|>>At the end of Monday, it was about 1,000 – again, an unheard of number.\n\nThis election could be one for the history book.\n\nThe Bangladeshi-American community has become a powerhouse voting bloc. <<|needle|>>The community could elect three council seats to Bangladeshi candidates and a fourth to a Yemeni-American, assuming they vote along ethnic and religious affiliations.\n\n(Both ethnic communities are of the Muslim faith.)\n\nThe community could also team up with the Yemeni community and unseat Mayor Karen Majewski and elect Abdul Algazali.\n\nAlgazali, a Yemeni-American, is currently on the city council and opted to challenge Majewski instead of seeking re-election to council.\n\nThis isn’t the first attempt by Algazali. <<|needle|>>He lost to her four years ago by 124 votes. <<|needle|>>He has the upper hand in this election since he beat her by 62 votes in the primary.Mayor Karen Majewski has some fighting words for her opponent and some city council candidates.\n\nMajewski is in the political fight of her career. <<|needle|>>She has been mayor for eight years and before that served on council. <<|needle|>>Hamtramck has consistently elected a Polish mayor as long as it’s been a city – since 1922.\n\nAs you can expect, she has some fighting words.\n\nOn her Facebook page she put this out on Tuesday:\n\n“They do not respect its residents enough to address them or its institutions enough to participate in them. <<|needle|>>They see Hamtramck as a means to an end and are using this community — the community we worry about, work for, and pour our hearts into — for their own ambitions.\n\n“It makes me angry. <<|needle|>>Does it make you angry? Then vote.”\n\nHer reference to those who don’t pay their taxes and water bills refer to her opponent and  City Councilmember Mohammed Hassan.\n\nIt came to light right after the primary election that Algazali was behind on his property taxes by three years on one of this properties.\n\nHe promptly paid about $2,000 right after the election.Mayoral hopeful Abdul Algazali not only votes against tax increases, he's late on paying them.\n\nIt was recently discovered that Hassan broke an agreement he signed in August with the city to pay $800 he owes for water service on his house on Neibel St. <<|needle|>>After The Review brought the matter to light, the city cut off his service.\n\nThe delinquencies also raised the question of whether the two could be considered “defaulters” to the city, which is against the city charter and is punishable by being thrown out of office.\n\nEmergency Manager Cathy Square dismissed the matter, saying that in Algazali’s case, it was merely an “oversight.”\n\nAnd in Hassan’s case, Square said she didn’t want to spend money to hire the city attorney and take the matter to court.\n\nWe’ll have more to add as election day proceeds.The Weirdness Around 'Alex from Target'\n\nYou might have noticed a new 'viral sensation' around a guy called 'Alex from Target'. <<|needle|>>Within a very short time, a picture of a... <<|needle|>>well... <<|needle|>>cute boy (if you are a teenage girl) started spreading like wildfire, resulting in Alex ending up on the Ellen DeGeneres Show.This is pretty spectacular, and I'm sure this has been quite an experience for both Alex and also the girl who originally posted it. <<|needle|>>It's not everyday that a cute girl takes your picture and you end up on Ellen. <<|needle|>>(Hint: Alex, send her some flowers)\n\nBut then things started to take a really weird turn, as the viral marketing agency Breakr claimed it was responsible for the whole thing. <<|needle|>>In a lengthy post over at Linkedin, Breakr's CEO wrote:\n\nYesterday, we had fun on Twitter with the hashtag #AlexFromTarget which ended up to be one of the most amazing social media experiments ever. <<|needle|>>We wanted to see how powerful the fangirl demographic was by taking a unknown good-looking kid and Target employee from Texas to overnight viral internet sensation. <<|needle|>>Abbie (@auscalum), one of our fangirls from Kensington, UK posted this picture of Alex Lee (@acl163) on Twitter. <<|needle|>>After spreading the word amongst our fangirl followers to trend #AlexFromTarget, we started adding fuel to the fire by tweeting about it to our bigger YouTube influencers.\n\nThe problem is that this doesn't seem to be true, and I decided to do a little digging. <<|needle|>>Was Breakr actually behind this? And was this entire viral sensation merely a orchestrated marketing stunt?\n\nFirst of all, let me tell you how it all started. <<|needle|>>I reached out to the person who originally posted it for an explanation.\n\nLast month, long before Breakr even noticed it, two girls, Brooklyn (@brooklynjreiff) and Alanna (@alannapage12), were having a conversation about this cute guy Alanna had seen in the local Target store. <<|needle|>>Alanna tweets about it:\n\nBrooklyn decided to take a picture of him and when she did, she tweeted the picture back to Alanna.\n\nThis is when the picture is born:Alanna then retweets it with a 'hot' symbol, and from there it starts to slowly spread.<image>After a week, the whole #AlexFromTarget phenomenon is already gaining a lot of momentum, causing another girl @auscalum to tweet the picture as well(after finding it on Tumblr). <<|needle|>>And, at this point, Brooklyn's picture of Alex has already built up a lot of viral energy.It is also at this point that Breakr comes into the picture, and claims that they are responsible for the whole thing. <<|needle|>>As they wrote:\n\nAbbie (@auscalum), one of our fangirls from Kensington, UK posted this picture of Alex Lee (@acl163) on Twitter. <<|needle|>>After spreading the word amongst our fangirl followers to trend #AlexFromTarget, we started adding fuel to the fire by tweeting about it to our bigger YouTube influencers.\n\nThis, of course, is not true since Brooklyn clearly posted the picture a week before that. <<|needle|>>I also asked Brooklyn if this was done as part of a Breakr campaign, and she told me that it wasn't. <<|needle|>>She doesn't even know who they are:\n\nI don't know who Breakr is so there is no way they could've 'set me up for this'. <<|needle|>>It was simply a fun convo between a friend & I before it went viral.\n\nSo, we know that Breakr wasn't the one who created this. <<|needle|>>And yet, their CEO told CNET:\n\nTruly, we never thought it'd go this far, but it proved that with a strong fan base and rally the fan girls, you can.\n\nBreakr also told CNET that \"Alex happens to work at Target with one of Breakr's kid fan base. <<|needle|>>He gave his permission to have the image taken.\"\n\nThis is also not true, as Alex pointed out in a couple of tweets saying:\n\nMy family and I have never heard of this company. <<|needle|>>[...] I didn't know the pic was taken or tweeted until my store manager showed me.\n\nBut maybe what Breakr is 'claiming' is not that they started it (even though that is what they are hinting at), but that they merely caused it to go viral with their 'fangirls'.\n\nWe then turn to Abbie, the fangirl Breakr specifically mentioned as being one of them, but she too says that she has never heard of Breakr\n\nAt this point, Breakr's claim starts to sound really dubious. <<|needle|>>They didn't start it, and the person they claim to have used to create the viral effect doesn't know them.\n\nLet's talk about the actual viral effect that Breakr could have influenced. <<|needle|>>In his post, Breakr's CEO writes:\n\nStephen launched a parody YouTube video to keep fueling the social media flame with our kids (as you can see in the video below, we were all in a Google Hangout the whole time). <<|needle|>>By controlling both sides of the conversation, we got more and more people to talk about the situation which kept the hashtag trending #1 on Twitter worldwide. <<|needle|>>Alex's Twitter account started with 2k+ followers around 2pm and is now at 340k+ followers.\n\nStephen is one of Breakr's influencers, who posted this rather negative video:\n\nHowever, there are a number of problems with this video. <<|needle|>>As you can hear, Stephen is complaining about how famous Alex has become. <<|needle|>>Meaning that Alex was already a viral sensation before this video was made.\n\nSecondly, this video is unlikely to have caused much viral effect at all, considering that Stephen is a guy with only 1,746 subscribers (which is hardly an influencer), and most of the activity on that video seems to have happened after Alex went viral.\n\nIn other words, Alex most likely caused Stephen's video to go viral, not the other way around. <<|needle|>>Stephen's video doesn't seem to have had much effect, but there is no way to accurately measure that. <<|needle|>>We can only look at when people were commenting and other such things. <<|needle|>>And pretty much all the comments on Stephen's video are only one day old, which would indicate that most of his views also happened within just the past day or so. <<|needle|>>That is after Alex's picture went viral, which also means that Breakr wasn't the cause of it.\n\nIt's the same story with other Breakr influencers I have looked at. <<|needle|>>One influencer that Breakr mentions is Philip Tatro, who posted a picture of himself with 'Alex' written on a sticker. <<|needle|>>Philip is pretty popular, with 14,000 followers, but this picture only has 61 retweets.\n\nIn other words, Philip has almost zero influence on Alex's viral effect, and he too is responding to a viral sensation that has already materialized. <<|needle|>>Again, Alex went viral before Breakr's influencers tried to use it for their own gains.\n\nThen we have this picture, posted the day after Breakr claims to have created this viral sensation, where the conversation around Alex on Breakr's app is... <<|needle|>>zero.This is hardly proof of a powerful Breakr fan base.\n\nIt's entirely likely, though, that Breakr thinks they are responsible for the viral effect. <<|needle|>>Their CEO might simply be suffering from delusion of grandeur, and are now trying to use this to make exaggerated claims to 'sell their business'.\n\nBut from what I can tell, Breakr had very little influence on this, if any. <<|needle|>>The real credit goes to Brooklyn and Alanna who started it, and people like Abbie and many others who fueled it.\n\nIn other words, there was nothing orchestrated about this. <<|needle|>>This was a real viral sensation that just grew and grew over the cause of a couple of weeks. <<|needle|>>At least, that's how it looks from my analysis.\n\nI have reached out to Breakr's CEO to hear his side of the story. <<|needle|>>Specifically, I have asked him two questions:\n\nFirst, How can you be responsible for a viral sensation when the people it is coming from don't know who you are? What exactly is it that you are claiming to have done?\n\nThe second question is about Breakr's business model, specifically that they seem to be using influencers without disclosure. <<|needle|>>I have asked him to answer: \"in accordance with FTC rules of disclosure, anyone who benefits financially from posting things on social channels (or anywhere else), must disclose that relationship. <<|needle|>>How are your Breakr influencers doing that?\"\n\nI also asked him to quantify the ROI of what Breakr is doing, Because, even if Breakr had been responsible, I don't see how it's useful for brands in terms of ROI. <<|needle|>>A video like the one from Stephen might have gained a number of views, but it's in no way positive for a brand like Target. <<|needle|>>As a media analyst, it seems like Breakr is creating the type of attention that has zero value for brands.\n\nAt the time of publishing this article, Breakr has yet to respond. <<|needle|>>Granted, I only gave him three hours to do so, so I will update this article when (or if) he does.\n\nIn any case, congrats Alex and Brooklyn on your fame.\n\nUpdate: And in what is starting to become a familiar pattern, people have now begun to post hate tweets to Abbie for thinking she is part of Breakr... <<|needle|>>including this:It's a new year. <<|needle|>>After the New Year's celebrations, either the up 'til midnight or the boardgame in front of the fireplace variety, I'm sure you're all aware we've left 2012 behind and entered 2013.\n\nWe survived Mayan predictions and post-holidays sales. <<|needle|>>Christmas tree needles have been swept up, or at least under the carpet and I've managed to pawn off the sugary treats that made up part of my holiday decor on helpful neighbors and friends.One of my favorite new year's activities is making lists.\n\nYep, I'm one of those kind of people. <<|needle|>>And my favorite kind of lists are derived from lists made by other people.\n\nIn my free moments I love to pull up all the end of year best book lists. <<|needle|>>The ones I like best aren't derived from sales figures, but from critical reviews.\n\nThese books help me grow as both a reader and writer.I think of them as my homegrown MFA program. <<|needle|>>They push me to be a better writer and thinker. <<|needle|>>Well, in theory they do. <<|needle|>>Sometimes they make me wonder what the critics were thinking, but that's okay too. <<|needle|>>It's part of the process of understanding what works for me as both writer and reader.\n\nOne book I've been obsessing over for almost two years is Cover of Snow, written by friend and fellow author Jenny Milchman.\n\nWhat else is new?Well, of course there's Losing Hope, but I've already read that one. <<|needle|>>Several times, in fact.\n\nMy second book in the Persephone Campbell series is a grown-up look at one woman's ongoing battle with her inner darkness and the Lord of the Underworld.\n\nIn addition to my OCDness over Jenny's new book, I spent the waning days of the year devouring Lidia Yuknavitch's The Chronology of Water and am about to embark on a Kathy Acker binge which I anticipate being hard on the psyche, but good for the soul.\n\nWhat about you? Are you making up a book list for the year? Are you in the middle of something unputdownable? Tell me! Tell me, please! And I'll add them to my Santa-claus long list. <<|needle|>>Who knows, maybe they'll even skip to the top.\n\nIn between books at the moment.\n\nI got a pile of books for Christmas. <<|needle|>>Including a couple on writing. <<|needle|>>I've already finished Save the Cat and am onto On Writing. <<|needle|>>But I have several novels calling out to be read as well. <<|needle|>>Oh it's so hard to pick where to start!\n\nCan't wait to read both Cover of Snow and Losing Hope! Yay for 2013!\n\nI just started The Sable City and it is fantastic.\n\nIn the middle of Alone in the Classroom by Canadian author Elizabeth Hay. <<|needle|>>I'm liking it!\n\nHappy New Year Johanna. <<|needle|>>I most definitely am in the middle of a book that's got me hooked! Losing Hope\n:) I've been reading plenty of romance lately so its perfect.\n\nI just finished ANNA DRESSED IN BLOOD and loved it! I will have to add these to my list for the year! It's going to be a busy one. <<|needle|>>:D\n\nI'm going to read Goblin Secrets next. <<|needle|>>My daughter just finished it and is dying to talk about it.\nI just finished Liar and Spy and loved it.\nThey are both MG but that's what I read mostly--Happy New Year!\n\nRachel, I loved On Writing.\n\nThanks Allie and I liked what I read about Sable City.\n\nAlex, can't wait to read your review of it.\n\nCathy, haven't heard of it, but will check it out.\n\nLisa, that book has been on my to-read list for a long time!\n\nKristen, it's so nice you and your daughter can share books! Happy New Year to you too.\n\nYour comment made ME SMILE... <<|needle|>>Thanks. <<|needle|>>You are too kind.\n\nTHIS year I WILL READ! I am ashamed of myself that I hadn't read a single book last year... <<|needle|>>BAD Michael, BAD Michael... <<|needle|>>SLAPS hand.\n\nBUt this year my goal is a small one, at least ONE book a month. <<|needle|>>That is attainable and if I can do more than GREAT...\n\nI have a major list waiting for me. <<|needle|>>When I get into them I will let you know. <<|needle|>>Editing today, but wanted to blog a bit to free up my mind.\n\nOne of my favorite presents this Christmas was made by my sister-in-law. <<|needle|>>It was a lovely, hand decorated notebook to be used for book lists. <<|needle|>>I'll be writing my lists down this year in something pretty, rather than at the back of a ratty notebook!\n\nI like your style of picking books. <<|needle|>>I definitely plan to make more time to read this year - and after this post, I'll think of it as writer's workshop time.\n\nCongratulations on your second book! Now I'm really behind on reading Losing Faith - will put that right here on my 2013 list. <<|needle|>>;)\n\nYou are great, Johanna. <<|needle|>>Your obsessing about my book is a made it moment for me :) I can't wait to read your next one--and hopefully have you sign it!!\n\nLOL. <<|needle|>>You crack me up with the read Losing Sanity a few times already. <<|needle|>>Hahaha. <<|needle|>>Anyway, I just finished Boneshaker by Cheri Priest and it was pretty good. <<|needle|>>Now I'm digging into The Windup Girl by Paola B(something I can't spell right now) and it is AWESOME. <<|needle|>>My favorite book of 2012 was The Peculiar by Stefan Bachman, but that's only because I haven't read yours yet.\n\nGreat list\nI too took the rest of the sugary treats and passed them to the neighbors!!!\n\nI'm reading how to write better, for now! But I have a long list to read-yours included ;D\n\nSince I started writing seriously, I haven't read nearly enough. <<|needle|>>I used to read 4-5 books a week. <<|needle|>>Now, I don't think I've even read 5 books this whole last year.\n\nI keep telling myself once the summer comes and I can sit by the pool, I'll be able to read more. <<|needle|>>We'll see.\n\nI have my MG list which never seems to whittle down -- it only grows longer. <<|needle|>>But that's okay; there's so much great writing out there to read. <<|needle|>>Currently I'm reading two different MG books, both of which contain an important, life-changing dog character. <<|needle|>>As a dog-lover, both are wonderful to me.\n\nWell, since you asked, I'm reading two wonderful books that are written by author friends: Shadows in Winter by FJ Fuller and Bitten by Dan O'Brien. <<|needle|>>The first is about a Finnish boy struggling between the traditional and modern worlds. <<|needle|>>The second is more of a thriller. <<|needle|>>Both are on Amazon.\n\nI am a lister, too! Just give me a project, and there's nothing more satisfying than checking items off a list as I complete them. <<|needle|>>I just finished Insurgent and really enjoyed it. <<|needle|>>Looking forward to lots of reading this year.\n\nRe-reading one my favorite authors, Alyson Richman. <<|needle|>>\"The Lost Wife\" is such an amazing love story I like to re-read a lot. <<|needle|>>And \"The Last VanGogh\" is brilliant. <<|needle|>>Love her!\n\nI love lists myself! Ill definitely have to check out these two books--especially the second one :)\nNutschell\nwww.thewritingnut.com\n\nOh, I love the Cover of Snow cover!! Sounds excellent, I'm adding that one to my own list. <<|needle|>>And of course I am anxious to read Losing Hope as well. <<|needle|>>My biggest problem is I've been spending so much time making my various lists I haven't had time to read or do much of anything else! I am a New Year's list fanatic LOL.Its object emperado unique. <<|needle|>>The Shah of Shahs should also be great from Ryszard. <<|needle|>>Published March 13th by Vintage first published Such a provenance makes conclusions or judgments about Ethiopia impossible to categorize. <<|needle|>>Amazon Renewed Refurbished products with a warranty. <<|needle|>>That would only make it more ridiculous. <<|needle|>>This regime outclasses modern ones in some ways: They always reached an invisible but perceptible point, beyond which silence fell.\n\nThe Throne consisted of little more than scuttlebutt concerning Haile Salassie One interesting nugget: But from my resolutely non-partisan perspective, a grand old time indeed.\n\nRather than writing about kids dropping acid, he writes about the utter insanity of the court of Ell Haile Selassie at the twilight of the Ethiopian Empire.\n\nOct 13, Monica rated it really liked it Shelves: Want to Read saving…. <<|needle|>>He’ll grab an ax, my gracious sir, not because he simply can’t sustain this new burden – he could carry it – he will rise empedador he feels that, in throwing the second burden onto his back suddenly and stealthily, you have tried to cheat him, you have treated him like an unthinking animal, you have trampled what remains of his already strangled dignity, taken him for an idiot who doesn’t see, feel, or understand.<image>Want to Read Currently Reading Read. <<|needle|>>No violent purges or collective bloodbaths ever occur. <<|needle|>>Nov 11, Rowena rated it liked it Shelves: The silence said, Everything is already known and clear, but clear in an obscure way, known unfathomably, dominating by being beyond helping. <<|needle|>>If one will not allow himself to wrong others, he will wrong himself. <<|needle|>>It all felt suddenly very near, and very recent.\n\nThis is a deplorable act of biased journalism, specifically targeting a great world leader.\n\nPerhaps this is my own error for having a wrong idea about what this book was trying to do. <<|needle|>>After completing this book, I would have to say, that the emperaror of this story is similar to nearly all other failed states.Lists with This Book. <<|needle|>>How much of this is actually Selassie and how much is carefully picked in order to emperadog fun of Stalin or Khrushchev or even Gomulka is up for debate, but that’s exactly what makes this book a masterpiece: This book whetted my appetite for learning more about Selassie and Ethiopia.\n\nSuddenly he remember This book was a gift to me from a friend who is a former Guardian journalist. <<|needle|>>And rather than being strict reportage, I suppose the American frame of reference for The Emperor is probably the “new journalism” stuff from the ’60s– Truman Capote, Tom Wolfe, Hunter Thompson, all that.\n\nApr 05, Adam rated it it was amazing Shelves: Great historical book describing the mood of the palace in Ethiopia under the rule of Haile Selassie.Apr 25, Conrad rated it it was amazing Shelves: Dialogue seems tad polished to be from real interviews, and seems to me to be a pointed allegory for the Soviet Union.\n\nThe downfall of autocracies seems to follow the same painful pattern they have for thousands of years. <<|needle|>>Write a customer review.\n\nRefresh and try again. <<|needle|>>I ca From the waning Kapusvinski regime forward, Kapuscinski fashioned a journalistic career out of exceedingly subtle swipes at the pretenses and tragicomic self-deception of Soviet-style Communism. <<|needle|>>The declivities of class and hierarchy within this kingdom exceed anything known to man. <<|needle|>>These simple masons gathered in front of the Palace they had built and began asking for want was due to them.\n\nGo to other writers for the facts, go Kapuscinski for something more. <<|needle|>>I’d like to read this book on Kindle Don’t have a Kindle?

details the rule and fall of another tyrant the last Shah of Iran in the Shah of Shahs. <<|needle|>>I can’t recommend this book highly enough.\n\nThere is no mention of the destroyed infrastructure

English Choose a language for shopping. <<|needle|>>For years I had heard what a wonderful writer Kapuscinski was but to me this book was a let down.We speak to the former magician's assistant about her relationship with dance partner Giovanni Pernice, staying in shape and following in the Strictly footsteps of her late husband Paul Daniels.\n\nAt least that's what it looks like as she makes her way across the room to talk all things Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nIt's the first in a series of chats with her about the popular BBC One dancing show, which this weekend will see the professionals and their celebrity partners take to the dance floor at the prestigious Blackpool Tower ballroom.\n\nAt 59, McGee is the oldest celebrity competitor in this year's crop of famous faces.\n\nNot that you'd know that by watching her on the dance floor.\n\nSo far she's waltzed all over the other competitors like Mollie King - who is 29 years her junior - and scored the first 40 of the series for her tango with Giovanni Pernice.She's in phenomenal shape physically, which she puts down to a healthy lifestyle fuelled by yoga and pilates.\n\n\"Because I've always been in showbusiness and had to be on stage in slinky dresses, I've always liked eating, and the only way I can eat everything I want, is to exercise,\" she explains matter-of-factly.\n\n\"But I've never been a gym girl. <<|needle|>>I did go to the gym for a couple of years and it's the only time I ever got injured!\"\n\nMcGee rose to fame alongside her late husband, magician Paul Daniels. <<|needle|>>The pair were married for more than 25 years until his death in March last year.\n\nOn April 1 this year, she shared a picture of them on their wedding day on Twitter, writing alongside it: \"29 years ago today.\"\n\nIn 2010, Daniels himself donned a tuxedo and competed in Strictly, where he was partnered with Ola Jordan. <<|needle|>>He was the second celebrity to be voted off the show during that year.\n\n\"It changes week by week,\" she says explaining that a recent stint of publicity for a Channel 5 programme talking about her late husband stirred up memories.\"I had a really emotional previous two weeks to this, because there was a big tribute to Paul on Channel 5 and I had to do a lot of interviews recalling Paul, and so it got to me... <<|needle|>>I know how much he would just love it.\n\n[Read more: 15 couples who were hit by the Strictly curse]\n\n\"But because he also did the show and lots of people on the show got to know him, his presence is kind of around and I think emotionally it's got to me more than I thought it would, is how I could describe it.\"\n\nHer flexibility and dancing prowess aside, McGee also grabbed headlines following her first dance on Strictly which saw her locking lips with 27-year-old Pernice as their routine ended.\n\nDays after the kiss, McGee told ITV's This Morning that Daniels would have \"loved\" the kiss, adding: \"And the fact that I caused, or appeared to have caused, this furore with the kiss on Saturday night... <<|needle|>>he just loved showbusiness, and that really was showbiz.\"\nShe laughs when asked about the headlines suggesting their friendship could have a romantic edge.\n\nShe explains: \"We really have a close relationship. <<|needle|>>It's a special friendship... <<|needle|>>it's not a love affair, it's an incredible, deep friendship.\"\nA few weeks later when we catch up McGee, she also brushes off any suggestion she has become the object of affection to younger admirers.\n\n\"If I have, I haven't noticed it. <<|needle|>>This programme takes over your life. <<|needle|>>I don't see anybody, I haven't been going out because it's so exhausting. <<|needle|>>Nobody knows who they are attracted to or who is going to ask you out, so I have no idea!\" she says.\n\nMcGee says making it the final stages of the competition is a nice way of giving back something to the professional dancers who work tirelessly alongside them.\n\nShe said: \"For all the pros, it's incredibly special to them and they've worked so hard for us that if we can get through, it's our way of paying them back.\"You have to trust each other and for us as well, if you are used to performing on your own, if you go wrong it's only you. <<|needle|>>Although I worked as part of a double act for a long time, so it's a similar sort of thing, I always knew that whatever I did, Paul would cover up anyway and it didn't matter, so I had an awful lot of freedom. <<|needle|>>But on this I'm really aware that if I go wrong I am letting Giovanni down. <<|needle|>>We are teams and you can't help that feeling inside. <<|needle|>>You feel guilty.\"\n\nAfter Strictly, there will be no slowing down for McGee.\n\nShe'll be on stage doing a Beauty and the Beast-themed pantomime at the Grand Opera House in York over the festive season.\nAnd then there's the BBC Two programme, The Pilgrimage, that she filmed earlier this year, which saw her take on the gruelling long distance trek of the Camino de Santiago in Spain.\n\nMcGee says the adventure, which saw her and other celebrities like Men Behaving Badly's Neil Morrissey and The Reverend Kate Bottley take on the epic journey, was good practise for Strictly.\n\nShe said: \"It was amazing. <<|needle|>>It kills you, but we did it the hard way. <<|needle|>>It prepared me for Strictly because we walked a hundred miles in two weeks and we stayed at the grottiest hostels, and they made us carry our rucksacks. <<|needle|>>We couldn't send the luggage ahead. <<|needle|>>It was the most amazing experience.\"\n\nSo far, McGee has managed the unimaginable during Strictly: she's gotten the normally stone-faced judge Craig Revel Horwood to get down on bended knee to salute her dancing, and head judge Shirley Ballas handing over her \"queen of Latin crown'\" to her.\nBut will she go on to win the Glitterball trophy and crown?\n\nThat would be magic.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing

those were probably the most common questions by anyone who was taking advantage of JUNO Week. <<|needle|>>It was crazy, it was busy, but it was an amazing, all Canadian week with so many captivating things to attend.\n\nWherever you ended up, I know you had a good time, but with everything that was going on, you had to make some tough decisions on where to go. <<|needle|>>Spill’s roster for the week leading up to the JUNO Gala Dinner & Awards, and 2017 JUNO Awards Broadcast started off with a behind the scenes tour of the Canadian Tire Centre, where we got to take a look at the beginning stages of the set up for the broadcast.\n\nIt’s pretty astounding to see a transformation like that, and it amazes even the people involved in the production of the awards. <<|needle|>>It takes a huge amount of people to get everything together, and they were all hard at work while we were escorted around the building by Lindsay Cox (Supervising Producer, Insight Productions), Allan Reid (President & CEO, CARAS/The JUNO Awards), and Dave Azouley (Technical Producer).\n\nThe tour took us from the entrance gate, through the back halls, where we passed the loading docks and saw all of the equipment being unloaded. <<|needle|>>While we walked the halls, we saw the talent’s dressing rooms, Shawn Mendes’s room standing out because of the mountain of fan mail that he’d received – one fan even sent him balloons. <<|needle|>>After we saw the dressing rooms being loaded in with outfits and equipment to keep the stars looking their best on their big night, we walked down the ramp into the arena where it all happens. <<|needle|>>In the beginning stages of a set like that, you get to see all of the markings on the ground that let people know very exact locations for things to go, the supports being put up for the massive amount of lighting equipment that goes into the production, as well as a lot of the gear needed to keep everything working. <<|needle|>>While it looked quite bare, looks can be quite deceiving, because this was just a stage in the big picture, and every stage is just as important as the next.<image>On Thursday, we headed to the JUNO Cup Practice, where rockers and former NHL players get acquainted (or re-acquainted in a lot of cases) and get the chance to skate the ice, get to know each other, speak to the media about the event and what it means to them, and most of all – hit the ice for a practice game to warm themselves up for the game the next day. <<|needle|>>Among the many participants, we got to speak to Missasauga’s own Jon Gallant (Bassist, Billy Talent). <<|needle|>>Gallant said that this is his favourite part of the week, and that Ottawa holds some fond memories for him as well. <<|needle|>>You will find the full conversation in the interview section of our website. <<|needle|>>Gallant was among many greats in Canadian music and hockey. <<|needle|>>The former NHL players had a pretty first rate line up, including five local players from the Ottawa Senators, Daniel Alfredsson, Brendan Bell, Chris Phillips, Jim Kyte, and Luke Richardson. <<|needle|>>Lead by the legendary Ottawa 67’s coach, Brian “Killer” Kilrea, the rockers weren’t doing to bad either. <<|needle|>>Among the rockers were father and son Jim Cuddy (Blue Rodeo) and Devin Cuddy (Devin Cuddy Band), Amanda Rheaume, Dallas Smith, Sam Roberts, Beard Guy (Walk Off The Earth). <<|needle|>>Both teams were jam packed with some pretty fine-tuned players, whether they live their lives behind an instrument, microphone, or hockey stick, Canada seems to breed good hockey players.This is where things started to get really busy. <<|needle|>>The days were full and the nights were busy and late, with bars serving until 3 a.m. <<|needle|>>and staying open until 4 a.m. <<|needle|>>for JUNOfest.\n\nFriday morning took us to our second view of the Canadian Tire Centre in a later production stage, one that allowed us to also attend an open rehearsal while at the set reveal. <<|needle|>>The room was much more full and almost fully lit, the stage had been built, and there was much more equipment.The production team was hard at work, as was the rest of the crew, as well as the band that we got the treat of seeing go through rehearsal and speak with afterwards. <<|needle|>>Hamilton puts out a lot of amazing artists, but The Arkells (nominated for Rock Album of the Year and Group of the Year) have made some really big waves in the music industry lately, and getting to see them rehearse for what was an exceptional performance was quite the treat. <<|needle|>>The band had a gospel choir, back up singers, and a very well choreographed ensemble. <<|needle|>>We got the chance to speak to Max Kerman of the Arkells after they’d finished their rehearsals, and he told us how exciting it is to bring this album to the JUNO’s stage and be a part of it. <<|needle|>>“You kind of have to take it one day at a time, especially when you’re putting out a record, but you hope that after nine months you can turn around and go oh look, we did a bunch of stuff from the record and now we get to play the JUNO Awards. <<|needle|>>You cross your fingers that that’s the way it goes and it doesn’t always go that way, but we’re really happy and fortunate that it went that way for us this time.”\n\nMax Kerman of the Arkells during rehearsal.\n\nThe JUNO Awards is held in a different location every year and has hit most of Canada in it’s time, and that’s what John Brunton (CEO, Insight Production, Executive Producer) said . <<|needle|>>This year was special for a few reasons, celebrating Canada’s 150th being the most apparent one. <<|needle|>>When asked if there was anything special coming out in the production, because it’s in Ottawa for the 150th, Alex Nadon (Production Designer – Lighting, Video Designer, and Director of Photography) said “this is my 10th JUNO’s actually, so it’s an important one for me, but when it comes to Ottawa and the 150th, I think there’s no better marriage. <<|needle|>>It’s so nice to be home in the capital for the 150th, it just feels so natural.”\n\nFriday night it was Rock Vs. <<|needle|>>Jock at the TD Place in Ottawa, when players hit the ice for the JUNO Cup in support of MusiCounts, Canada’s music education charity. <<|needle|>>This is a special night for everyone involved, and did it ever show. <<|needle|>>Usually when you go to a hockey game, it’s so competitive that the players are all high strung, and it’s very rare to see them smile, but there wasn’t a face without a smirk all night. <<|needle|>>The game finished with a whopping score of 13-12 for the Jock’s, but let’s be honest, the score was never what mattered. <<|needle|>>In between periods there were skill games, a shootout that went to tie breaker, and an absolutely priceless sing-off between Daniel Alfredsson and Jim Cuddy. <<|needle|>>That sing-off was definitely a big highlight of the night, and it all wrapped up with the players in the middle of the ice, watching the highlight reel.Last, but definitely not least leading up to the Gala and Awards, came JUNOfest. <<|needle|>>After the game, House of Targ was just a short walk down Bank Street, where we caught the Dirty Nil (Breakthrough Group of the Year winner), and Dilly Dally (Alternative Album of the Year nominee). <<|needle|>>While the bands are similar in sound, the guys from Dirty Nil really know how to get the crowd going and put on an absolutely phenomenal show. <<|needle|>>Now that’s not to say that Dilly Dally didn’t as well, because I could honestly say that it was as if we had gone back in time and were watching Hole play, but the vocalist outdid Courtney Love.Dirty Nil at House of Targ\n\nDilly Dally at House of Targ\n\nSaturday, after the JUNO Gala Dinner & Awards (review to be found separately) the market was the next stop. <<|needle|>>The Dominion tavern brought us Ornaments. <<|needle|>>The local Ottawa band is known for their electric live show, and they did not disappoint. <<|needle|>>There may only be three of them, but the sound is big enough to get the whole venue moving to the beat. <<|needle|>>Having them play JUNOfest made the decision of where to go that night quite easy and anyone who went definitely did not regret their choice.Racing over to Irene’s to catch William Prince’s set was a must after Ornaments finished theirs. <<|needle|>>Prince had a big day that day, but if you were in the crowd at Irene’s, you still felt like you were the only thing that mattered to him. <<|needle|>>He put on a very personal show almost directly after playing the In Memoriam tribute to musicians passed at the Gala, which is a much different environment, and also quite the honour. <<|needle|>>Comparable to a Johnny Cash voice, Prince’s baritone voice takes you away and you can feel it like you can feel the beat of a bass guitar in your chest, his vocals vibrate all the way through you and leave you with

6 years old. <<|needle|>>This means it may help with Dysbiosis.\n\nLlama Natural's adult probiotic gummies have over 235 real customer reviews on amazon and a 4.3 out of 5 star rating which isn't perfect but does indicate that the gummies are not a scam.In May 2020, Brooke who was confirmed to have purchased Llama Gummies shared that the taste was excellent and they were easy to eat. <<|needle|>>She didn't share any feedback related to her digestive health.\n\nAnother customer called Nicole praised the taste and colorful packaging but didn't share if the Bacillus probiotic bacteria had any effect on her gut health. <<|needle|>>She did mention that shipping was fast.\n\nIn 2021, Alycia shared that after taking Llama's probiotics for 3 days she began to start experiencing gas and general digestive side effects. <<|needle|>>This persisted for 2 weeks but the effects continued. <<|needle|>>Her review does show that the probiotic bacteria was starting to work in her gut and it would have been interesting to see what happened if she stuck it out for a full month.\n\nHow To Refund Llama's Naturals\n\nNot everyone will experience the benefits of Llama Naturals probiotic gummies. <<|needle|>>Llama Naturals have a pretty straight forward refund policy that can be started by either emailing support@llamanaturals.com or calling (312) 509-4661.\n\nYou have 30 days from the date of purchase to start the refund process and it can only be done if you have ordered up to 3 bottles maximum. <<|needle|>>You may have to send the probiotic gummies back to receive your money back but it's best to check with the Llama Naturals team for full details.Save 20% with coupon code\n\nLlama naturals is a great company that has able to carve out a niche for itself in the short amount of time since its inception.\n\nThere products are natural and only used plant-based ingredients that are usually free from all common allergens.\n\nI really loved their prebiotic and probiotic gummies due to several factors.\n\nThese gummies are quite tasty and easy to eat due to their small size, they are also quite effective and don't have any severe side effects for most of the people.\n\nOh and by the way, the official reason for calling their company Llama Naturals is because, \"Llamas are amazing\". <<|needle|>>That's straight from the Llamas mouth.HOME! It’s been a busy week of getting the businesses back in order and welcoming Jin home. <<|needle|>>LOADS of gigs too. <<|needle|>>Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday. <<|needle|>>Woo Hoo!

AMAZING!!While I’m sitting at my computer just doing nothing much I am listening to some opera being played in the next apartment block or maybe upstairs. <<|needle|>>It’s just snippets and floats around, lovely.\n\nI went out to collect Jin this morning and my battery was dead. <<|needle|>>DAMNIT!! Always something after a holiday, eh? Thank goodness for two things; Jin also has a car so I was able to collect him and a battery is easily and not very expensive to replace.\n\nYAY! Jin is home. <<|needle|>>He was delayed a couple of hours in China and then the runways were busy so another hour at Sydney. <<|needle|>>Finally he got off the train at Parramatta around 10.40am and we went for Yum Cha! I’m so glad to have him home.\n\nWe jump started my car and I went down to our local car mechanic, Josh. <<|needle|>>He’s so sweet and always super helpful. <<|needle|>>15 minutes and AUD$185 later I have a zippy little car again.\n\nYAY!

It was so crowded. <<|needle|>>They maybe could have fitted two more seats in the auditorium, that’s how many people were there, and they were rowdy AF. <<|needle|>>My handsome Co-Host Tim and I had an uphill battle just getting them to listen, ALL NIGHT! There were shows, I even played Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act with a super cute quartet of Bearded Nuns to do I Will Follow Him. <<|needle|>>Riotous! With my payment I’d bought a table and had Jin, Kath, Alice, TinaG, Sam, Kerri and Simon there. <<|needle|>>Sadly Phil was too sick to come. <<|needle|>>Having them there made the whole event ultra special. <<|needle|>>TinaG won a four night holiday in Tasmania for four people! AMAZING!\n\nAfter the event we sat around and Jin and I were able to give everyone their holiday gifts. <<|needle|>>I think they liked them. <<|needle|>>Really, we just like buying stuff for people.\n\nGot home and we were both so bushed that we basically went straight to bed. <<|needle|>>Jin was so tired that he was snoring like a freight train and restless, jumping all over the place. <<|needle|>>I jumped out of our bed and hit the spare. <<|needle|>>BLISS!\n\nSOTMorning: So Nude by Costume National\n\nMy voice is gone. <<|needle|>>Thank goodness I have today off. <<|needle|>>My first day off since returning from the honeymoon. <<|needle|>>I’ve earned a lazy day. <<|needle|>>Jin also went to work the day after he came home and has been non stop, he works tonight so I’m letting him have a sleep in today. <<|needle|>>When he surfaces I’ll take him for brunch.\n\nWe took the dogs for a walk.\n\nThen we had brunch around the corner at a new cafe. <<|needle|>>It’s pretty cool and the food was excellent.\n\nWe were going to do other stuff but…….\n\nHad a knock down fight on the phone with an incredibly condescending, aggressive and threatening woman whose Turbo Trivia fundraising event went awry while we were on honeymoon. <<|needle|>>I get it, she had a fairly huge issue. <<|needle|>>Our hostess forgot that she had the gig and when they finally found her she got to the venue VERY late. <<|needle|>>They filled with games till she got there. <<|needle|>>When she arrived she went straight to work and fulfilled her obligations. <<|needle|>> Some people are so mean, like REALLY mean. <<|needle|>>I hate confrontation of this kind and she is making it personal, and scary. <<|needle|>>I’ve already lost sleep over it and then today she was just awful. <<|needle|>>GAK!Was going to go out and hang at the Heaven Social Dance but it’s my only day off this week so I decided to stay home. <<|needle|>>Have some down time with Lucifer Season 4 on Netflix.\n\nSlept in till 11am!

Find out about the history of Valentine’s Day, from the ancient Roman ritual of Lupercalia that welcomed spring to the card-giving customs of Victorian England.\n\nThe Legend of St. <<|needle|>>Valentine\n\nThe history of Valentine’s Day–and the story of its patron saint–is shrouded in mystery. <<|needle|>>We do know that February has long been celebrated as a month of romance and that St. <<|needle|>>Valentine’s Day, as we know it today, contains vestiges of both Christian and ancient Roman tradition. <<|needle|>>But who was Saint Valentine, and how did he become associated with this ancient rite?The Catholic Church recognizes at least three different saints named Valentine or Valentinus, all of whom were martyred. <<|needle|>>One legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. <<|needle|>>When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men. <<|needle|>>Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. <<|needle|>>When Valentine’s actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death. <<|needle|>>Still, others insist that it was Saint Valentine of Terni, a bishop, who was the true namesake of the holiday. <<|needle|>>He, too, was beheaded by Claudius II outside Rome.\n\nOther stories suggest that Valentine may have been killed for attempting to help Christians escape harsh Roman prisons, where they were often beaten and tortured. <<|needle|>>According to one legend, an imprisoned Valentine actually sent the first “valentine” greeting himself after he fell in love with a young girl–possibly his jailor’s daughter–who visited him during his confinement. <<|needle|>>Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter signed “From your Valentine,” an expression that is still in use today. <<|needle|>>Although the truth behind the Valentine legends is murky, the stories all emphasize his appeal as a sympathetic, heroic and–most importantly–romantic figure. <<|needle|>>By the Middle Ages[1], perhaps thanks to this reputation, Valentine would become one of the most popular saints in England and France.\n\nOrigins of Valentine’s Day: A Pagan Festival in FebruaryWhile some believe that Valentine’s Day is celebrated in the middle of February to commemorate the anniversary of Valentine’s death or burial–which probably occurred around A.D. <<|needle|>>270–others claim that the Christian church may have decided to place St. <<|needle|>>Valentine’s feast day in the middle of February in an effort to “Christianize” the pagan celebration of Lupercalia[2]. <<|needle|>>Celebrated at the ides of February, or February 15, Lupercalia was a fertility festival dedicated to Faunus, the Roman god of agriculture, as well as to the Roman founders Romulus and Remus.\n\nTo begin the festival, members of the Luperci, an order of Roman priests, would gather at a sacred cave where the infants Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, were believed to have been cared for by a she-wolf or Lupa. <<|needle|>>The priests would sacrifice a goat, for fertility, and a dog, for purification. <<|needle|>>They would then strip the goat’s hide into strips, dip them into the sacrificial blood and take to the streets, gently slapping both women and crop fields with the goat hide. <<|needle|>>Far from being fearful, Roman women welcomed the touch of the hides because it was believed to make them more fertile in the coming year. <<|needle|>>Later in the day, according to legend, all the young women in the city would place their names in a big urn. <<|needle|>>The city’s bachelors would each choose a name and become paired for the year with his chosen woman. <<|needle|>>These matches often ended in marriage.\n\nValentine’s Day: A Day of Romance\n\nLupercalia survived the initial rise of Christianity[3] but was outlawed—as it was deemed “un-Christian”–at the end of the 5th century, when Pope Gelasius declared February 14 St. <<|needle|>>Valentine’s Day. <<|needle|>>It was not until much later, however, that the day became definitively associated with love. <<|needle|>>During the Middle Ages, it was commonly believed in France and England that February 14 was the beginning of birds’ mating season, which added to the idea that the middle of Valentine’s Day should be a day for romance. <<|needle|>>The English poet Geoffrey Chaucer[4] was the first to record St. <<|needle|>>Valentine’s Day as a day of romantic celebration in his 1375 poem “Parliament of Foules,” writing, “For this was sent on Seynt Valentyne’s day / Whan every foul cometh there to choose his mate.”\n\nValentine greetings were popular as far back as the Middle Ages, though written Valentine’s didn’t begin to appear until after 1400. <<|needle|>>The oldest known valentine still in existence today was a poem written in 1415 by Charles, Duke of Orleans, to his wife while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London[5] following his capture at the Battle of Agincourt[6]. <<|needle|>>(The greeting is now part of the manuscript collection of the British Library in London, England.) Several years later, it is believed that King Henry V[7] hired a writer named John Lydgate to compose a valentine note to Catherine of Valois.\n\nBy the middle of the 18th, it was common for friends and lovers of all social classes to exchange small tokens of affection or handwritten notes, and by 1900 printed cards began to replace written letters due to improvements in printing technology. <<|needle|>>Ready-made cards were an easy way for people to express their emotions in a time when direct expression of one’s feelings was discouraged. <<|needle|>>Cheaper postage rates also contributed to an increase in the popularity of sending Valentine’s Day greetings.Americans probably began exchanging hand-made valentines in the early 1700s. <<|needle|>>In the 1840s, Esther A. <<|needle|>>Howland began selling the first mass-produced valentines in America. <<|needle|>>Howland, known as the “Mother of the Valentine,” made elaborate creations with real lace, ribbons and colorful pictures known as “scrap.” Today, according to the Greeting Card Association, an estimated 145 million Valentine’s Day cards are sent each year, making Valentine’s Day the second largest card-sending holiday of the year (more cards are sent at Christmas[8]). <<|needle|>>Women purchase approximately 85 percent of all valentines.A look at the best and worst presents i got.\nBy mofu\nOn\nBest & Worst Christmas Presents I Got\n\nThis is my first article and with Christmas just around the corner, I thought I'd take a look at the best and worst presents I ever received. <<|needle|>>It's a personal look at the toys and how I felt about them rather than a description of them, but maybe it will bring back some memories.I was really young and can't remember exactly what year I got this. <<|needle|>>What I do remember is that the box for it was enormous, however being only 3 or 4 at the time I suppose most things were big to me. <<|needle|>>It had a lot of cool things to play with but the plane was the coolest and I played with that for years.This was probably one of the best gifts I've ever been given, although it was for the whole family. <<|needle|>>We also got Millipede, Basketball and a couple of others to play. <<|needle|>>I hadn't really played too many games before so firing this up for the first time was an incredible experience. <<|needle|>>Even though it looks like a hulking chunk of ugly, it looked pretty spiffy back then!\n1986/87 - Snake MountainThis was another toy that came in a huge box. <<|needle|>>In fact my parents didn't have enough wrapping paper to conceal it so they had to use newspaper.\nIt looked more comical than evil - I always thought the front looked like a monster with a snotty nose. <<|needle|>>An unfortunate situation had occurred though - no batteries. <<|needle|>>This was because my parents suffered from a debilitating disease, \"chronic batterius obliviousness\". <<|needle|>>This disorder meant that my parents either didn't get batteries, didn't get enough or got the wrong type. <<|needle|>>It spoiled many christmases and I just hope it is just a generation thing and not genetic.\n\n1986 - Battle of the Planets God PhoenixI loved this toy. <<|needle|>>It was completely different to the Phoenix on the TV show (it was actually from the 2nd series of Gatchaman - the Japanese version which we didn't get). <<|needle|>>It was metal with plastic wings and little plastic versions of the individual craft that G Force used. <<|needle|>>These vehicles fit into compartments all over the Phoenix.\nEven though my brother broke one of the wings off I still loved it.<image>This was a Transformer that was featured in the Transformers Movie - the only problem was, I hadn't seen it. <<|needle|>>My grandmother gave me this and I had to pretend that I loved it, however deep inside I disliked it immensely. <<|needle|>>Not only did I not know the character, but the damn thing was hard to transform! It took strength and long fingernails. <<|needle|>>It actually hurt to play with which kinda sucks.I loved the A Team and I loved Mr T, and was thrilled to rip open my present and find him staring out of the box. <<|needle|>>That was until I actually opened it. <<|needle|>>Within a minute of pulling him out, one of the arms fell off. <<|needle|>>When the tears had stopped and I played with it a bit more the other one fell off. <<|needle|>>My mum said we'd take it back and get it replaced, only back then the shops didn't re-open for about a week after Christmas. <<|needle|>>In the end I swapped it for Thunderpunch Heman.\n\nUm - it was 199o.... In a world of Transformers, Ninja Turtles, CDs etc. <<|needle|>>why would I want a toy truck? I mean come on, it didn't even transform into something. <<|needle|>>Pfft!I'm not even sure if it was this brand or another, however one thing was clear - it was crap. <<|needle|>>I had to salvage the batteries from something else as once again my parents had failed to get batteries for it. <<|needle|>>This thing was cool for a while then the feedback and static started. <<|needle|>>I thought it was the batteries, so when the shops re-opened off I went to get replacements but it was still doing it. <<|needle|>>We took it back to the toy store and got another and the same thing happened. <<|needle|>>I was quite disappointed because if it had worked it would have been cool.This Transformer was huge, but it was more like putting a model together rather than transforming something. <<|needle|>>There were loads of parts to it, basically a tank that ran on a track. <<|needle|>>The track came apart and when you connected the track pieces together it became the legs. <<|needle|>>All good and well if all the parts didn't get lost. <<|needle|>>It pretty much stayed under the bed collecting dust. <<|needle|>>The worst part is it probably cost my parents a fortune!\n19\nLogin To Vote!\nMore Articles From mofu16\nmofu\nKiller TV Filler\nA list of my favourite gap fillers from the 80's.\n\n25\nQuote O' Matic\nRabbit Pooh: \"Rabbit: I suggest we call a team meeting. <<|needle|>>Pooh: But haven't we met each other already?

new, easy to implement rendering technique allows developers to vary the amount of processing power spent across the image, to spend time and increase quality in the areas where they are most needed. <<|needle|>>Since virtual reality demands both a high performance and a high image quality, VRS is the perfect fit for VR experiences, especially when used in conjunction with eye tracking.\n\nIn this blog, we explain the technology behind VRS in detail and show how a Beta version of Autodesk VRED used in a demo at SIGGRAPH 2019 leverages this technology to improve the VR experience in an HTC VIVE Pro Eye.\n\nThe following video should be watched full screen, at the highest possible quality available. <<|needle|>>VRS quality differences can sometimes be hard to see at lower resolutions.\n\nWhat is Variable Rate Shading?With VRS it is possible to change the shading rate, and for example shade only one sample per four pixels, or even only shade one sample per sixteen pixels. <<|needle|>>This can lead to a dramatic reduction in rendering complexity, speeding up the rendering. <<|needle|>>This improvement in rendering performance can provide the needed push to make an application perform fast enough for VR rendering. <<|needle|>>This reduction in shading rate comes with a reduction in quality, but depending on the image region or the material that is rendered this quality reduction can be made almost unnoticeable, as discussed later in this blog.<image>Impact of VRS on Quality\n\nTo examine the effects of VRS in Autodesk VRED, we partnered with PNY and Autodesk to create an impressive, interactive demo shown at SIGGRAPH earlier this year. <<|needle|>>It’s based on a design review scenario in VR running on two NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPUs in VR SLI. <<|needle|>>In this demo, VRS is used not only for foveated rendering, but also to show the effects of content adaptive shading by setting the shading rate dependent on the material. <<|needle|>>The following screenshots were taken from this demo in Autodesk VRED.\n\nFirst we want to show examples of how the different VRS shading rates impact the rendering quality of different kinds of materials. <<|needle|>>Materials with high detail or high frequency show the strongest degradation in quality when rendered with a lower shading rate. <<|needle|>>Especially materials with text, such as the dashboard in our screenshots, should not be reduced in shading rate, to retain readability.\n\nOther materials show a more subtle change in quality when rendered at different VRS levels. <<|needle|>>For example, the leather on the steering wheel in the following screenshot has a subtle structure on it which will get lost in low shading rates, but this effect is much harder to spot in the application compared to the dashboard example.\n\nSome materials, especially materials with low detail, show almost no change when they are rendered with lower shading rates. <<|needle|>>The smooth surfaces of the car’s interior are great examples of this.\n\nTo optimize shading rate, VRS provides controls for specifying the shading rate not only per image region, but also per material. <<|needle|>>This technique is called “Content Adaptive Shading” which provides a mechanism for rendering every material with the quality it needs to produce a high quality and high performance VR experience.\n\nWith Content Adaptive Shading it is even possible to render materials in a higher quality than just shading one sample per pixel, to perform selective super sampling. <<|needle|>>The carbon fibre material in our demo is a great example for this — many procedural materials fall into this category.\n\nThis variant of Content Adaptive Shading can be interesting for non-VR experiences, too. <<|needle|>>If a scene has a few materials that are prone to flicker with low anti-aliasing settings, the overall quality of the rendering can be improved by only rendering these materials at a high quality, without the performance impact of rendering the whole scene at a higher quality level.\n\nThe Autodesk VRED VRS demo shows the effect of the available VRS settings on different materials in three stages.\n\nThe first stage can toggle through a number of VRS quality levels that are applied to the whole screen. <<|needle|>>The user can see that the material on the hood looks better with higher VRS quality settings.\n\nEven with two and four samples per pixel, this material still shows slight moiré effects in certain areas.\n\nRendering the scene with eight samples per pixel results in the best quality, and removes the moiré artifacts from the rendering.\n\nIn the system used for our demo, rendering the scene using VR SLI on two NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPUs, the performance in this view is at full 90 frames per second for all VRS modes, up to four samples per pixel. <<|needle|>>Increasing the VRS quality to eight samples per pixel results in a frame rate drop to 66 frames per second. <<|needle|>>This quality improvement comes with a high cost because this setting is applied for the whole screen.The second stage shows the effects of foveated rendering. <<|needle|>>When using eight samples per pixel over the whole screen for a complex scene, the rendering performance can drop and degrade the VR experience.\n\nFoveated rendering makes use of the eye tracking technology available in the HTC Vive Pro Eye to detect where the user is looking. <<|needle|>>The region of the display where the user is looking is rendered with a higher quality sampling rate to produce higher image quality in that region; the sampling rate and corresponding image quality fall off toward the periphery. <<|needle|>>This results in a high performance, high quality VR experience.\n\nFor the interior viewpoint shown above, using eight samples per pixel over the entire screen results in a frame-rate of 28 frames per second, which is not high enough for a good VR experience. <<|needle|>>Enabling foveated rendering almost doubles this performance. <<|needle|>>With 53 frames per second the VR experience is noticeably better.The third stage shows a technique called Content Adaptive Rendering. <<|needle|>>With foveated rendering, some materials can start flickering in the periphery, because they react strongly to VRS quality changes.\n\nFor the viewpoint shown above, the lower VRS quality in the periphery makes the car hood flicker noticeably. <<|needle|>>With foveated rendering alone, the performance for this view is 78 frames per second. <<|needle|>>The frame rate alone would indicate a great VR experience, but the flickering in the periphery can distract the user. <<|needle|>>Enabling Content Adaptive Rendering lowers the frame rate to 76 frames per second, a drop that is not noticeable. <<|needle|>>Content Adaptive Rendering removes the flickering from the car hood though, greatly improving the VR experience.To implement VRS in your own application, refer to the

means it's time to honor those who have served in the military.\n\nIt may not seem like a natural shift in careers, but there are actually many famous faces who have served in the military over the years.\n\nMany of their experiences vary, and they have served across various branches and at different times in their lives.\n\nFrom musicians to actors and beyond, here are nine stars who served their country:Adam Driver is among the stars to have served their country, though his experiences may not have been very helpful in preparing to appear in \"Star Wars.\"\n\nHe enlisted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but was medically discharged after a biking accident before ever being sent to war, according to GQ.circa 1957: American singer and actor Elvis Presley (1935-1977) performing outdoors on a small stage to the adulation of a young crowd. <<|needle|>>(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\n\nElvis Presley famously served in the military, but what makes his turn so unique was that it came after he had become famous.\n\nIn 1957, after he'd found great musical success, Presley was drafted by the Army and served for two years after getting a deferment to star in \"King Creole,\" according to Military.com.<image>Jimi Hendrix famously upset nationalists with his rock'n'roll take on the national anthem at Woodstock in 1969, but years before, the musician served in the military himself.\n\nPer Military.com, Hendrix was busted for stealing cars and was given the choice of serving or going to jail. <<|needle|>>After just a year, he was discharged over an alleged ankle injury, though rumors persist that it was his attitude that got him sent home.Like Presley, Selleck was already working in showbiz when he was drafted.\n\nThe soon-to-be star was working for Twentieth

<<|needle|>>Peter's Basilica in Rome is the largest sacred building in the world. <<|needle|>>Actually it is not. <<|needle|>>Here are seven sightseeing myths to debunk\n\nMyth 1: St. <<|needle|>>Peter's in Rome is the largest\n\nThe most visited church in the world – yes, of course: almost 60,000 people can accommodate the cathedral during mass. <<|needle|>>But this is not the largest church in the world in terms of size. <<|needle|>>Much larger than the Vatican Cathedral Basilica Notre Dame de la Paix in African Yamoussoukro, the administrative capital of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, or the Republic of the Ivory Coast.Myth 2: The Leaning Tower of Pisa is the most “falling”\n\nIn fact, the most “falling” building in the world (of the miraculous!) is located in Germany & nbsp; – a 13th-century church in the East Frisian village of Zuurhusen. <<|needle|>>With its inclination of 5.19 degrees, its tower was included in the Guinness Book of Records in July 2007 as the building with the largest angle of inclination from nature. <<|needle|>>For comparison, the Leaning Tower of Pisa “falls” only 3.97 degrees.There is another building, the work of human hands and one of the most interesting works of modern architecture, — Capital Gate(“gate of the capital”) in Abu Dhabi. <<|needle|>>A skyscraper that “falls” 18 degrees is listed in the Guinness Book as the building with the largest angle of inclination in the world.\n\nMyth 3: The water in the Dead Sea is the saltiest\n\n28% – exactly how much salt is in the sea between Israel, Jordan and Palestine. <<|needle|>>This is seven times more than in the Mediterranean. <<|needle|>>Certainly a lot. <<|needle|>>But there is even saltier water on our planet – the endorheic Lake Assal in the Republic of Djibouti, a state in the Horn of Africa. <<|needle|>>Its coast is the lowest point in Africa, and the salt content in the water approaches 35%.This lake has been known to Europeans for a long time – at least the last 100 years, but this does not add to its popularity. <<|needle|>>Few people are in a hurry to rest in East Africa. <<|needle|>>The same is true for other even more saline areas of the Earth. <<|needle|>>For example, in Antarctica there are lakes that, due to the high salt content, do not freeze even at frosts over 30 degrees, but somehow there are no people who want to relax there.Myth 4: Niagara Falls is the highest\n\nIn fact, the highest waterfall on Earth is located much to the south, but also in the Americas – in Venezuela. <<|needle|>>Angel Falls (“waterfall of the deepest place”) in the rainforests in the southeast of the country has a height of 979 meters!Water falls from the top of Auyantepui, the “mountain of the devil.” In the hot season, part of it manages to evaporate on the way to the ground, which forms a cloud of transparent water droplets – a completely unique sight, which, however, is not so easy to admire: the journey to the waterfall takes about a day through the jungle.\n\nMyth 5: The North Cape in Europe is the northernmost\n\nEvery year, more than 200,000 tourists go to the Norwegian island of Magerø to stand on the northernmost European land. <<|needle|>>And they are wrong, because the northernmost land in the European Union lies almost a kilometer and a half further – this is Cape Knivskjöllodden.As for Europe as such, there are islands to the north – Svalbard and Franz Josef Land. <<|needle|>>But Russia is in charge here, and besides, getting to these places is not so easy, unlike the North Cape today it is part of the longest of the continental walking routes called E1.Myth 6: The Cape of Good Hope in Africa is the southernmostTo Cape Agulhas (Egolny) from the Cape of Good Hope, you need to drive another 155 kilometers to the southeast. <<|needle|>>It is Cape Agulhas that is the southernmost point of Africa and, in addition, the geographical border separating the Atlantic and Indian oceans.For navigators in the old days, the area here was dangerous: the Needle Shoal became famous for its shallow depth and fast undercurrent, which formed breakers and caused frequent shipwrecks. <<|needle|>>In addition, a very specific magnetic anomaly was observed in this place. <<|needle|>>For example, in the 19th century, the compass needle deviated 30 degrees to the west. <<|needle|>>Actually, the name of the place comes from here: from the Portuguese agulha – a needle, in this case – a magnetic compass needle.\n\nMyth 7: The Sahara Desert is the most sandy\n\nIn fact, only 20% of this largest desert in the world is really made of sand and giant sand dunes. <<|needle|>>The rest of 's surface is rocks, gravel, boulders, pebbles.\n\nGeologists have discovered what the desert has known for thousands of years both dry and wet periods, which, in fact, formed its current unique appearance. <<|needle|>>The Sahara is also striking in its size – 8.6 million square kilometers of surface. <<|needle|>>For

to do when you’re a shepherdess, writer, photographer, public speaker and mother to nine children!\n\nAmanda is known to millions as The Yorkshire Shepherdess through the Channel 5 factual television programme Our Yorkshire Farm. <<|needle|>>She may be considered a TV personality whose fifth book is currently being loaded onto the shelves of bookshops around the country. <<|needle|>>But in reality Amanda is first and foremost a farmer who has 1,000 sheep to look after. <<|needle|>>And she never shies away from getting her hands dirty.\n\nThe day before our conversation, Amanda received an early-morning telephone call to say some of her cows had escaped and were running amok.\n\n“They were heading down the road, they’d knocked someone’s wing mirror off and they were making for a camp site. <<|needle|>>I couldn’t have woken up and anticipated that, could I?”\n\n“There’s a thing called prioritising. <<|needle|>>Sometimes I go with my heart and not my head.”\n\nBut Amanda, who points out she is definitely not a domestic goddess, found a bonus to the problem.\n\n“While I was putting the cows back I found a load of raspberry bushes. <<|needle|>>I thought ‘what I should do now is go back home, tidy up, load the dishwasher and get my baking done.’ But actually my head was saying ‘get the raspberries before anybody else or the birds find them.’\n\n“There’s a thing called prioritising. <<|needle|>>Sometimes I go with my heart and not my head. <<|needle|>>The kids all had big smiles on their faces even though they were covered with raspberries. <<|needle|>>The point is we’re happy, we’re getting on and that’ll do.”\n\nYorkshire people are known for being down to earth, straight-talking and unpretentious. <<|needle|>>Amanda who laughs a lot during our chat fits the bill perfectly.“There’s always summat to do and fitting it all in can be a bit of a nightmare. <<|needle|>>It’s hard, it’s tough but it’s also inspiring,” says Amanda of her way of life at Ravenseat, the traditional farm in Upper Swaledale that she runs with her husband Clive.\n\nDespite being a townie – she was born in Huddersfield in 1974 – Amanda developed a love of the great outdoors at an early age. <<|needle|>>After accidentally stumbling on a book called Hill Shepherd by John and Eliza Forder, she set her heart on becoming a shepherdess. <<|needle|>>So does reality live up to the young Amanda’s expectations?\n\n“It’s a bit of a rollercoaster ride because there are so many variables that affect your daily life. <<|needle|>>It’s a never-ending circle that you don’t really understand until you’re doing it. <<|needle|>>It’s not all sunshine and birds. <<|needle|>>At the end of the day, what we’re doing is real.”\n\nAmanda approaches everything with energy and charm. <<|needle|>>It’s one of the reasons why so many people tune into the Channel 5 series about life on her farm. <<|needle|>>But she never had a plan to have a television career and, like most things, it started accidentally.Just after getting married Amanda and Clive pitched a tent in one of their fields. <<|needle|>>Walkers passing by asked if it was there to supply refreshments.\n\n“That sparked an idea in my mind that there were 16,000 people a year walking through the farm and I simply offered to make them a cup of tea.\n\n“One day a person came who was dressed like a walker. <<|needle|>>He turned out to be a TV scout. <<|needle|>>He was looking for people to be involved in a show called The Dales with Ade Edmondson.\n\n“We were one of the families who signed up to do that. <<|needle|>>Afterwards I was approached by a literary agent who asked me if I’d be interested in writing a book to tell my story. <<|needle|>>Being a bit of a chancer, I thought ‘why not? I’ll give it a go.’”\n\nThe Yorkshire Shepherdess book got to number three in the best sellers chart, leading to an approach to make a television series. <<|needle|>>But she doesn’t see herself as a TV personality.\n\n“When people say ‘author’, I shudder. <<|needle|>>When people say ‘photographer’, I shake. <<|needle|>>I’m just myself, Jill of all trades, master of none. <<|needle|>>I just take opportunities and see if I’m any good at it,” she says modestly.\n\n“I think that’s the best thing about living in the countryside in a place like this: it gives you head space.”\n\n“The fact that it’s a bit of all those things probably sums me up perfectly. <<|needle|>>When it comes to order and planning, is there any? Not really.\n\nAmanda took inspiration from Hill Shepherd, the book which she says was visually beautiful.\n\n“Those pictures were real and gritty. <<|needle|>>They told the story. <<|needle|>>And that’s where I wanted to go because I take pictures. <<|needle|>>I do a virtual diary. <<|needle|>>Every day, whatever I’m doing, I’m taking pictures. <<|needle|>>It reminds me of what’s been happening.“My camera is the worst in the history of the world. <<|needle|>>It’s held together with gaffer tape and I’m having real trouble with the on-off switch for the simple reason there was a ripe banana in the camera case and somehow it managed to get itself into the switch.”\n\nObviously Amanda’s family plays a large part in her photos and she stresses it’s essential for them to be involved in life on the farm.\n\n“For the children to feel a sense of self-worth and to feel they’re important, they must take some responsibility. <<|needle|>>Ooh, that sounds terrible, doesn’t it?\n\n“Is it really that bad to ask them to go and get some sticks for the fire or feed the hens or get some eggs? When they come back, that sense of joy they get, that they’re a part of what we do – it’s a life lesson.”\n\nWhen she speaks about her children whose ages range from five to 20, she does so with understandable pride and love.\n\n“Raven’s away at uni doing a course in biomedicine. <<|needle|>>Reuben’s got himself a job, he’s got an apprenticeship.\n\n“He could have bought himself a car but he said he was okay with his moped to get to work and he’s bought himself a digger because he wants to go contract digging. <<|needle|>>I think that’s brilliant. <<|needle|>>That’s him taking the initiative.\n\n“His school said it was the first time they’d ever had a kid leave school who had the opportunity to go to three jobs. <<|needle|>>I think that’s great.\n\n“Keep your expectations low! I’ll wait and see what happens.”\n\n“So maybe my lackadaisical, hands-off way has made the children more independent and that will pay dividends in the long run, I hope, making them happier, stronger, well-adjusted kids.”\n\nSo what can we expect from Amanda in 2022?

Last week. <<|needle|>>So, last Thursday, Ms. <<|needle|>>Liz Prince and I flew to Charlotte, NC to attend Heroes Con 2008 (Mr. <<|needle|>>Joe joined us a day late due to prior commitments). <<|needle|>>On our connecting flight, we ran into a Mr. <<|needle|>>Kaz Strzepek, and, once on the ground in Charlotte, we were greeted by a Mr. <<|needle|>>Greg Means and Mr. <<|needle|>>Alec Longstreth (thank you thank you thank you for carting our bum-bums around!). <<|needle|>>Liz and I parted ways, for I had a rendez-vous with a Mr. <<|needle|>>Paolo Rivera. <<|needle|>>I settled into my temporary abode and topped of the evening with some CABLE TELEVISION (le droolz).\nThe next morning, I awoke to sunny downtown Charlotte. <<|needle|>>But first things first: I completed my daily ritual of rigorous calisthenics and cleansed my body (with complimentary hotel toiletries, of course) in preparation for the big day that lay ahead. <<|needle|>>As I stepped into the sweet, Southern air, I let my eyes fall upon the concrete wonder that is the Charlotte Convention Center. <<|needle|>>This would be my semi-lucrative day-time dwelling for the next two and a half days...\n\nOK ENOUGH WITH THE WRITING!! WHERE ARE THE PRETTY (<---somewhat subjective) PICTURES?!?!?! AHHHHH!!!I\"M SORRY IF I FORGOT ANYONE/MADE ANYONE LOOK NOT OK!!!1!1\nBut really, I had some time to kill sitting at my table, so I tried to draw everyone I knew (or knew of) within eyeshot. <<|needle|>>Also, some peeps I hung out with afterwards (I can't say that I wasn't inspired by Mr. <<|needle|>>Matthew Reidsma's SPX drawings of yesteryear). <<|needle|>>What I wouldn't give to be marooned on the Indie Island...\n\nI had awesome neighbors!

Are you feeling the AWESOMENESS yet?\n\nBut then, Mr. <<|needle|>>Joe and I tried to fly back to Boston. <<|needle|>>Here's us waiting in the Charlotte Airport:FOR SEVEN HOURS.\nLuckily, we ran into Mr. <<|needle|>>Brian Ralph (who was waiting for the same flight to Baltimore) and convinced him to watch our bags, eat at Chili's and draw comics with us.\nOnce we FINALLY arrived in Baltimore at around 12:30 AM, there were no more flights to Boston (le sadz et le tiredz). <<|needle|>>The next possible flight we could take was at 6:30 AM. <<|needle|>>AWESOME (<---that one is sarcastic, not to be confused with the three previous \"AWESOMEs\"). <<|needle|>>Brian kindly offered up his place (thank you, again), but we figured it'd be better just to wait it out:IT WAS COLD, BRIGHT, AND LOUD (no thank you, rude, evil swearing night workers who blatantly KNEW that we were trying to catch a wink and didn't give a flying FUDGESICLE). <<|needle|>>Regardless, Mr. <<|needle|>>Joe and I made it safe and sound back to Beantown around 7:30 the next morning.\n\nIn short, I would totally do Heroes Con next year (if Charlotte would have me again, that is). <<|needle|>>A super-duper thanks to Mr. <<|needle|>>Dustin Harbin for alerting me of this con, and making it a great show. <<|needle|>>And for looking ultra-swanky in that hawt white suit. <<|needle|>>YOWZERS.\n\nOh, and I do realize that this might just be the weirdest blog post on Dots For Eyes yet. <<|needle|>>heh heh\n\nSorry to hear about the flight problems. <<|needle|>>Lisa and I had to spend the night in JFK on our anniversary!!!\n\nLove your drawerings. <<|needle|>>Glad we got to hang at the auction for a bit. <<|needle|>>Paulo's parents were neat.\n\nI loved squeaky Iron Man!

That's really good. <<|needle|>>Because Senate Republicans have given him absolutely no reason to play nice with them nor observe the asinine gentility that obfuscates the partisan rancor of that institution.Obama didn't appear to have much of a grasp on the way the legislative game was played in his first term. <<|needle|>>It's certainly fair to say that at least part of the blame for his problems with Congressional Republicans -- a small part -- lies with those early missteps.\n\nPossibly the biggest miscalculation of the early Obama presidency was not understanding the vein of ethno-nationalist hatred his election had opened on the right wing. <<|needle|>>It's as if the administration thought that the outpouring of hatred from the general election ravings of Sarah Palin was the end, not the beginning.\n\nWe all know better now.The radically right wing turn of the Republican Party in the past eight years is not solely about Obama -- but it's mostly about him. <<|needle|>>True, a lot of the shift has its roots in post integration white backlash from the mid to late 1960s. <<|needle|>>And a lot of the shift has to do with the rise of the religious right in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBut that's all contextual, and it goes back decades. <<|needle|>>This GOP, the one we have now, after 2008, and especially 2010, is a direct reaction to the nation's first black president.\n\nThat kind of racial hatred and animus isn't going to be deflected by rational appeals to political maturity. <<|needle|>>It just can't be reasoned with.\n\nThe judiciary has been a perfect example of this recalcitrance and its expression in refusing to allow Obama to fulfill his Constitutional duties. <<|needle|>>The Republican led Senate has simply refused to allow Obama's judicial nominees to go forward. <<|needle|>>It's led to a federal judiciary with too many vacancies- and this was before Scalia's death.\n\nThe right believes Obama is a usurper of the presidency. <<|needle|>>When the birther movement wasn't able to prove he was unqualified to serve, it fell to the Republican Party's Congressional delegation to just stop the President from governing and fulfilling the duties the Constitution requires of the office.\n\nSo now that Obama has the opportunity to replace one of the most arch-conservative jurists in U.S. <<|needle|>>Supreme Court history with a more liberal justice, he's going for it.The appetizer is served before the main course.The dessert is served after the main course.The main course is served after the appetizer."}

and progesterone) has a 9% reduced risk of death from any cause.\n\nPublished in May 2022, Nurunnahar Akter’s study looked at the health records from over 300,000 women in the UK, aged between 46-65 years, in the time period of 1984-2017. <<|needle|>>The aim was to see if estrogen-only and combined HRT had any effects on the mortality rate of women during that period.\n\nThe researchers matched women taking HRT with women who did not take HRT but were of a similar age and sociodemographic group and studied their health for on average 13 years.\n\nAfter ruling out existing health conditions such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease, the study found that, compared to the non-HRT users, women who had taken combined HRT (estrogen and progesterone) had on average a 9% lower risk of death from any cause.\n\nThe study found no significant effect on the risk of death for the women taking estrogen-only HRT (in any age group).\n\nYou can read this study in full here.\n\nLouise Pryor, President of Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, who commissioned the study, said:\n\n“This is a very welcome study. <<|needle|>>In our clinic, which receives referrals from every corner of the UK, sadly we often see women who have been misinformed about the risks of HRT. <<|needle|>>If prescribed appropriately based on rigorous empirical research, HRT is not only safe but has the potential to prevent bad health outcomes, including several diseases that particularly affect women, such as osteoporosis and dementia. <<|needle|>>This timely study helps reassure women that evidence-based HRT

current phase of the MCU. <<|needle|>>A decade of Marvel blockbusters over 22 films has culminated to this melting hotpot of a final stand against a villain who in his arrogance believes himself to be ‘inevitable’. <<|needle|>>Over these films, which started with ‘Iron Man’ and was always building towards this, a grand plan unfurled in front of our eyes, and MCU took on the proportions of a modern-day saga. <<|needle|>>Naturally, it garnered a fan base so massive and strong that the film has transcended from the very medium of cinema to become a pop culture sensation and phenomena. <<|needle|>>The moment something becomes transcendental, especially art, critiquing it and even approaching it, takes a degree of nuance. <<|needle|>>Thus for ‘Avengers: Endgame’, I shall approach it as a fan of the Marvel movies, and as a fan of cinema. <<|needle|>>The two approaches yield surprisingly different reactions to the film that marks the grand masterpiece of directors Anthony and Joe Russo. <<|needle|>>SPOILERS AHEAD.To understand ‘Avengers: Endgame’ one must first realize that it is the continuation of ‘Avengers: Infinity War‘. <<|needle|>>To refresh your memory, ‘Infinity War’ was about Thanos’ quest for the Infinity Stones coming to an end. <<|needle|>>His goal was to ensure balance in the universe by wiping out half of the universe’s population and despite the Avengers coming together valiantly to try and stop him, they failed. <<|needle|>>In one fateful finger snap, Thanos achieved his goal, and the film ended with half the population gone, including many of the Avengers.\n\n‘Endgame’ picks up from where ‘Infinity War’ left off, except we see the effect of the snap from the perspective of Clint Barton or Hawkeye, played by Jeremy Renner. <<|needle|>>Fans will remember that Barton quit the group of heroes since he had too much to lose once he became a father, and his family started growing. <<|needle|>>Thus, to lose his family in front of his eyes was a smart way to microscopically portray the feeling of pain, loss, and helplessness that must have echoed across the universe when Thanos snapped his fingers. <<|needle|>>Next up we see Tony Stark, and Nebula, who changed sides recently, struggle to survive in outer space. <<|needle|>>They suddenly run into none other than Captain Marvel.\n\nNow people might wonder how this happened, especially since the post-credits of the ‘Captain Marvel‘ film showed her answer Nick Fury’s pager and meet the remaining Avengers. <<|needle|>>However, even in a film with an expansive runtime of 3 hours, there is so much ground to cover, that timelines are sped up. <<|needle|>>We realize that Captain America had assigned her on this mission, and Danvers is not one to fail. <<|needle|>>With all the surviving Avengers reunited, they decide to make good on the sentiments expressed in the first ‘Avengers‘ film – if they cannot defend the earth, they will be sure to avenge it.\n\nSurprisingly, in the very first half of the film, the heroes confront a Thanos who has given in to agrarian life and brutally defeat him. <<|needle|>>However, this does not change things as Thanos has already destroyed the Infinity Stones, making the reversal of his actions impossible. <<|needle|>>Faced with an insurmountable problem, the scriptwriters fall back on the most obvious way out, that is, time travel. <<|needle|>>Ant-Man, who in ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’ was trapped in the Quantum Realm, comes out five years later.\n\nThe five-year jump gives the directors a good way to show the current crop of heroes who will take down Thanos. <<|needle|>>We see a new Hulk in the form of Professor Hulk, a combination of Bruce Banner’s brains and Hulk’s brawn. <<|needle|>>Hawkeye too is brought back into the team but he is a changed man, not averse to vigilante justice. <<|needle|>>Tony, who is the luckiest of the lot, has made the best out of a bad situation and has a family with Pepper. <<|needle|>>However, the heroes soon realize that the quantum realm is the key to time travel, and if they do go back, they can stop Thanos. <<|needle|>>Stark comes to the rescue, and as they retrieve the stones, we are shown clips from older Marvel movies where the timing coincides. <<|needle|>>Thanos becomes aware of this plan and comes to earth to stop them, just as Banner’s Hulk manages to snap his fingers in an attempt to undo Thanos’ action. <<|needle|>>What follows is a gratuitous fight, and mega battle sequence, which ends with Thanos defeated, and the heroes standing tall, although at great personal cost. <<|needle|>>The film eventually wraps up, giving a fitting conclusion to every character, and marking the end of an era of Marvel movies.First, let me get the fanboy side of me out of the way and say it was a completely immersive experience. <<|needle|>>The audience feels like they are part of the shared experience, as moments of the film draws cheers and loud yells from all corners of the hall. <<|needle|>>It is a film made for the fans, and the Russo brothers have pandered to fan culture so much, as to have us eating out of their hands during certain moments of the film.\n\nOver the three hours, we revisit some of our favorite Marvel movie sequences, including the battle at New York in the first Avengers movie, and Peter Quill’s daring heist in ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’. <<|needle|>>As the ‘time heist’ (Ant-Man’s term) is underway, there is many a tear shed as the heroes show their humanity, Tony in meeting his father Howard, Steve in seeing Peggy again after so long, and Thor encountering his mother, who died in ‘Thor: The Dark World’. <<|needle|>>Among all this, Black Widow sacrifices herself for the Soul Stone, proving how the Avengers became the only family she felt a part of, for her entire life. <<|needle|>>Tearjerkers aside, the battle sequences are amazing. <<|needle|>>We not only get to see Thor wield Mjolnir and his battle ax again but Captain America also proves himself worthy of the hammer and gives Thanos a beating he will not likely forget.\n\nAs the battle escalates to an all-out war, one only needs to remember what Umberto Eco said in ‘The Myth of Superman‘ about the inevitability of the hero’s return. <<|needle|>>All the characters snapped away in ‘Infinity War’ come back, and the battle is on. <<|needle|>>While there are many spectacular moments there itself, it is best witnessed than described. <<|needle|>>However, there is a moment of raw female power, which almost reminded me of Quentin Tarantino’s ‘Death Proof’, where all the women gang up to beat the serial killing sadist driver. <<|needle|>>‘Endgame’ sees the likes of Okoye, Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, and Scarlet Witch teaming up in an iconic fight scene.<image>‘Endgame’ has its set of flaws too. <<|needle|>>It is not even the strongest movie in the MCU — which I believe ‘Captain America: The Winter Soldier’ to be. <<|needle|>>Time travel is a really desperate narrative ploy to fall back on, and even the time travel theory has some loose ends. <<|needle|>>One example would be Captain America deciding to stay back in time and spend a life with Peggy. <<|needle|>>However, when he returns aged, he brings back his shield, but not Thor’s hammer, which he was carrying with him while traveling. <<|needle|>>Some parts of the film feel too mechanical as well, as though the dialogues were sanitized through a rigorous process, and knowing the amount of effort that went into the movie, we would not be surprised.\n\nAs far as characters go, the film gives its major actors quality screen time. <<|needle|>>We see a lot of Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Chirs Hemsworth, as Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor respectively. <<|needle|>>Unhindered by interruptions from minor characters, these three portray roles that will remain an integral part of pop culture. <<|needle|>>Downey Jr. <<|needle|>>is superb as Iron Man, channeling all of Stark’s sass to show his moments of weakness, humanity, and the ultimate hero’s sacrifice. <<|needle|>>When he snaps his fingers to destroy Thanos’ army, and in the process kill himself, one can only remember Captain America’s charge against him in the first ‘Avengers’ movie about Stark never making the sacrificial play. <<|needle|>>The person, who everyone believed put his self-interest first, gave it all up, his family, and shot at happiness, for the greater good. <<|needle|>>The themes dealt with here are those of family, be it the one you are born in or the one you make. <<|needle|>>The Avengers are a family, and the family sticks and fights together.\n\nIt is in no way the finest MCU movie, but it is the most resonant, the most poignant of the lot. <<|needle|>>While all the other MCU movies until this point, have had an aura of anticipation, ‘Avengers: Endgame’ was permeated with an essence of retrospection. <<|needle|>>If you want my personal opinion of it as a film, it’s good but not great. <<|needle|>>However, ‘Endgame’ is not just a film, it is a cultural phenomenon and a shared experience where the viewers are being rewarded for their loyalty and commitment to the franchise. <<|needle|>>As far as rewards go, we could not have asked for anything better, a film with emotions, action, resolution, and respect to its history.\n\nOh, and by the way, if this is the last cameo by the late Stan Lee in MCU movies, then it was a satisfactory one. <<|needle|>>‘Endgame’ is for the fans of Marvel, not particularly lovers of cinema, and as Lee’s car plate reads, that is ‘Nuff said’.Performers & Creatives working in the EU after January 1st\n\nFirst, I should say that I fully understand and applaud the union of which I have been a proud

obstacles they face in their lives and their friendship over the course of several decades.\n\nSo with all that said, here’s everything we know about the future of Firefly Lane on Netflix.\n\nWhen will Season 2 of Firefly Lane be on Netflix?\n\nIn an interview with Netflix head of drama Jinny Howe, it was thought that Firefly Lane would drop on Netflix in November 2022.\n\nIn the Deadline interview, Howe teased the upcoming season saying:\n\n“It’s a really, really beautiful season, Katherine and Sarah, their dynamic is so, so strong, so I’m really excited to have fans return to that show.”\n\nThat’s not the case, however, with Netflix confirming in October 2022 that the show will conclude with a supersized final season, with the first batch of episodes coming in December 2022.\n\nPer Netflix, here’s how the release schedule for season 2 of Firefly Lane will be:When was Firefly Lane season 2 renewed for season 2?\n\nIt took a few months following the release of season 1 but Netflix officially announced that Firefly Lane is returning for a second season on May 27th, 2021.\n\nThe news was announced through their social media platforms and on YouTube, where actresses Katherine Heigel and Sarah Chalke answered fan questions and made the official announcement.\n\nMaggie Friedman has been confirmed to be returning as showrunner for season 2. <<|needle|>>Michael Spiller (Modern Family, Scrubs) will direct in season 2.\n\nThe first season doesn’t cover all of the material from the novel, so there is still much of Tully and Kate’s story left to tell. <<|needle|>>There’s also a sequel to the novel, Fly Away, which extends the story even further.\n\nWhat to expect from Firefly Lane season 2\n\nSpoilers ahead! If you haven’t finished season 1, don’t read any further!\n\nAt the end of season 1, we’re left with two very contrasting images of Tully and Kate’s relationship.\n\nAfter Tully quits her show, the pair enjoy a cozy catch-up by the firepit, where Tully promises Kate that she’ll help her get a job when she’s hired again.\n\nWe then have a flashforward to a future scene, where the pair have an emotional confrontation at a funeral, with Kate stating that she never wants to see Tully again.Undoubtedly, season 2 will explain what happens to fracture Tully and Kate’s relationship so irreparably. <<|needle|>>However, given that this is a show about friendship, we can’t believe these two won’t make up in the end.\n\nAlthough the confrontational finale takes place at a funeral, it is not obvious whose funeral it is. <<|needle|>>Since Tully arrives to pay her respect, it’s clearly the funeral of someone closest to Kate.\n\nWe have two likely candidates: Kate’s ex-husband, Johnny, who left for Iraq, or Kate’s elderly father. <<|needle|>>Either way, the second season will cover the impact this has on Kate and her teenage daughter, Marah.\n\nWe think season 2 would also explore what happens next with Tully’s career, including if she ever offers Kate that job.\n\nOf course, since Firefly Lane is based on a fairly famous novel, you don’t have to search too hard to find out what actually happens next to Tully and Kate. <<|needle|>>Be careful out there: you might not like what you see…\n\nAlthough yet to be confirmed, episode titles have been uploaded to IMDb. <<|needle|>>They are as follows:In late September 2021, Netflix announced four new additions to the cast via Deadline.\n\nIgnacio Serricchio, the Argentinian actor who will be playing Don West in Lost in Space in December 2021, has joined the cast of Firefly Lane and is set to play Danny Diaz. <<|needle|>>Danny is described as a cocky sportscaster who has become a reporter and develops chemistry with Tully.\n\nGreg Germann, known for his role on Grey’s Anatomy, will play Benedict Binswanger in season 2, a part of an influential logging family.\n\nIndia de Beaufort, who appeared in Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist and will also appear in Netflix’s Slumberland, will play Charlotte. <<|needle|>>The character is described as a quiet aspiring journalist who has a crush on Johnny Ryan.\n\nFinally, Jolene Purdy will play Justine Jordan in season 2, an upbeat talent agent with a knack for keeping a positive demeanor. <<|needle|>>Purdy is most known for her recent roles in The White Lotus and WandaVision.\n\nReturning cast members confirmed to be back for season 2 include:<image>We can confirm several of the directors on board for the second season, including:\n\nWhere is Firefly Lane season 2 in production?\n\nFilming for season 2 will once again take place in Vancouver, Canada and has begun as of the end of August 2021.\n\nWe first learned that season 2 was due to kick off filming earlier in the year with the preliminary filming dates taking place between August 30th and production in some form running through to April 20th, 2022.\n\nFans of the show on Twitter spotted filming in places like Kennedy’s Pub in North Delta and St. <<|needle|>>Andrews Church in Vancouver.\n\nThanks!!

Of course. <<|needle|>>Is slapping “extreme rules” onto this a lame method of making it a hardcore style match? Sure. <<|needle|>>But hey, it’s still a “weird stipulation” and I have to give them credit for doing something different that doesn’t happen all that often, as well as something that makes quite a bit of sense…minus the fact that Evans clearly lost to Lynch twice with no wiggle room to say she is owed a rematch.\n\nSo I’m splitting the difference. <<|needle|>>This isn’t a Hot, but it isn’t a Cold. <<|needle|>>It’s in the middle range, where I’m willing to give WWE the benefit of the doubt that this might be interesting.I used to be more nervous that Kingston would drop the title here to Brock Lesnar, who would cash in his Money in the Bank contract after a grueling hardcore match of sorts, in order to set up an appearance at SummerSlam.\n\nInstead, now that it’s Samoa Joe who will face Kingston, I don’t think that will happen. <<|needle|>>I imagine Lesnar will show up at SummerSlam to win the title, instead, and this match will be able to just be what it can be without factoring in that cash-in.\n\nAnd that’s great! I’m a big fan of both Joe and Kofi, and I’m excited to see what they can do together. <<|needle|>>This is a fresh match with two guys who normally aren’t given this sort of spotlight and are still not boring to me, so I’m 100% down.<image>I’ve been sick of this Shane McMahon storyline for months now, I haven’t wanted to see McIntyre and Reigns do anything together at WrestleMania or past that point (as I feel they’re wasting what could have been a solid program for the Universal Championship down the line and this isn’t doing anything for me) and as much as Taker is my #2 favorite of all time, he isn’t the same guy he used to be.\n\nOn paper, and from the bubble perspective of “how WWE views everything right now”, this match is supposed to be monumental, but I just can’t bring myself to really care as much as they want me to.\n\nSide note: It’s funny how WWE thinks having Extreme Rules and No Holds Barred and Triple Threat and all should be different style matches, as if we’re fooled by that phrasing into thinking it’s anything but all No Disqualification. <<|needle|>>Whatever. <<|needle|>>At least that stipulation will help this match with its flexibility.I’m less interested in the match and more interested in where they go afterward, which means I just want to hit the fast-forward button.\n\nThere are only three possible places this goes.\n\n1) Bliss wins the title and continues to have Cross at her side and they drag out the inevitable split.\n\n2) Bliss wins the title and drops Cross, and we have either Cross/Bliss or Cross/Bliss/Bayley at SummerSlam.\n\n3) Bayley retains the title and the plan is to have Sasha Banks return and do something.\n\nI really hope we don’t just see Bliss lose, only for Cross to try to win her back again and repeat exactly what happened at Stomping Grounds. <<|needle|>>That will just show that WWE keeps stalling and doesn’t have a plan of what to do next.\n\nIn any scenario, I’m just not feeling it. <<|needle|>>That’s a shame, as this story was one of the better ones for Stomping Grounds. <<|needle|>>I get that the purpose of the feud is that we should be asking why Bliss gets the title shot, but that shouldn’t translate to “and I don’t really want to see a repeat of what we saw before, so can we just skip this and get to the next part of the story instead of dragging it out?” WWE wants me to be angry at Bliss for taking the title shot, and I’m just unenthusiastic toward WWE for having written this onto the card, instead.These two are great athletes. <<|needle|>>There’s no reason to think they’ll have anything but a great match.\n\nDo they give the title to Styles and go with the heat, despite how Ricochet could use a stronger title reign to make sure people know he’s someone to get invested in? Or do they go with Ricochet coming out on top to prove himself, despite how that makes it harder to continue this feud going forward?\n\nCurious. <<|needle|>>But I’ll be checking out the match along the way, that’s for sure, and hoping they don’t cop out with a disqualification to stall things like they’ve done a lot over the past few years in these sorts of scenarios.I know these two teams are insanely talented and will put on a great show, if given the time and flexibility to work with. <<|needle|>>There’s no doubt in my mind about their performance levels.Summer House Season 7: Is It Renewed?

International Space Station.\n\n“Almost like an engine on a car, a big engine on a car,” recalled NASA astronaut Nicole P. <<|needle|>>Stott, one of six astronauts on board as STS-133, the final mission for Discovery, launched Feb. <<|needle|>>24, 2011. <<|needle|>>Nothing, Stott said, can prepare a person for what happens as the clock strikes zero: solid rocket booster ignition.\n\n“You wonder if you were on a launch pad,” Stott said. <<|needle|>>“Almost immediately, it feels like there are three of you sitting on top of you.”Stott’s 13-day mission in 2011 was her second trip to space—Stott spent 91 days aboard the International Space Sation in 2009—a highlight, if not the culmination, of a space flight career launched, in many ways, at a small Florida airport, riding in her father’s Skybolt.\n\nStott grew up in Clearwater, Fla., where her father, Fred Passano, was a founding member of Experimental Aircraft Association Chapter 282 at Clearwater Air Park. <<|needle|>>Stott said her early experience in aviation “is probably the single greatest influence on the path that led me to being an astronaut.\n\nAs long as I can remember, I’ve been hanging out at an airport somewhere.”\n\nStott earned her pilot’s certificate as a student at St. <<|needle|>>Petersburg College (then known as St. <<|needle|>>Petersburg Junior College), and went on to earn a bachelor’s degree at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and a master’s degree in engineering management from Central Florida University. <<|needle|>>Stott landed an engineering job with NASA in 1988, long before she considered applying for astronaut training. <<|needle|>>Encouraged by mentors, Stott, an instrument-rated private pilot, began astronaut training in 2000, and said her aviation experience provided a solid foundation for space flight. <<|needle|>>While NASA does not require previous flight experience, an introduction to the T-38 jet trainer comes very early in the training program.\n\n“There really is something about the way you have to manage yourself in an airplane,” Stott said. <<|needle|>>Crew members must work as a team, maintain situational awareness, and respond to changing circumstances.\n\nStott said flight training and an aeronautical education proved valuable in many ways, including assignments manipulating a robotic arm aboard the International Space Station.\n\n“All the same skills you would use as a pilot you’re using to move that arm around in this three dimensional space,” Stott said. <<|needle|>>“To me, it all really does come back to skills of flying.”Nicole Stott, age 15, taxis with her father in his Skybolt at Clearwater Air Park in Florida. <<|needle|>>Photo courtesy of Nicole Stott.\n\nStott credits her father with lighting the spark of aviation interest, and has sought opportunities to pay that forward. <<|needle|>>An active member of the EAA chapter, Stott has been the star attraction for many participants in the local Young Eagles program.\n\nHer advice to the future aviators?\n\n“To not even include the word ‘impossible’ in your vocabulary,” Stott said.\n\nThe final mission aboard Discovery behind her, Stott is working now to prepare a new generation of astronauts. <<|needle|>>Her current NASA assignment has her stationed in Florida as NASA gears up to assist commercial operators preparing for space missions. <<|needle|>>NASA is launching a program this year to assist commercial operators with funding and technical expertise, forging public-private partnerships that aim to foster a new generation of American-made space vehicles.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed doing that because it helps me see what’s coming in the future,” Stott said.Stott said she is also on a “personal mission” to spread the word about the benefits of space flight, noting many advances in technology that improve life on Earth came directly from space. <<|needle|>>Sophisticated filtration systems that produce clean drinking water from waste, now being deployed in places like Haiti and Rwanda where potable water is scarce, are just one example, Stott said.\n\n“I can tell you that everything we did up there, and it didn’t matter if it was a science experiment or a deliberate research activity, everything about it had a two-fold purpose,” Stott said: “Improving life here on Earth, and helping us figure out how to live off our planet. <<|needle|>>It really is a beautiful thing.”\n\nStott said the new chapter in the nation’s space odyssey now unfolding is reminiscent of the early days of aviation.\n\n“It’s neat to me to see people like Burt Rutan and these other companies looking at it from all different ways,” Stott said. <<|needle|>>“Even just suborbital stuff is really cool.”<image>Astronaut Nicole Stott took this picture from space, framing a photograph of EAA Chapter 282 members whom she credits with helping launch her space career. <<|needle|>>Photo courtesy of Nicole Stott.All You Need To Know About Shah Rukh Khan's 'Fan'King Khan may not have managed to enthrall the audience and set the cash registers ringing with 'Dilwale', but Shah Rukh Khan is set to be come back with his upcoming film 'Fan'.\n\nThe film is produced by Aditya Chopra under the Yash Raj Films banner and it's set to release on 15 April 2016.\n\nAccording to reports, the story of 'Fan' is based on a fan's obsession with the world's biggest movie star. <<|needle|>>Here's all you need to know about the movie:\n\nDirected by Maneesh Sharma, this SRK starrer movie will see the actor pull off some dangerous action

him and the entire 'Fan' team shoot there.\"\n\nSRK tweeted: \"Thanx Madame Tussauds. <<|needle|>>Allowing us 2 shoot Fan with all 'ur' stars & our star Maneesh. <<|needle|>>Very gracious of u.

they control.\n\nEl Chapo’s former associate Pablo Escobar often gave away lavish gifts as a show of gratitude to those who displayed loyalty to him, especially during Christmas.\n\nColombian drug lord Escobar once ordered the construction of more than 200 homes for poor families living in the Medellin slum of Moravia, and also built more than 50 soccer pitches. <<|needle|>>He also made his henchmen delivers loads of gifts ahead of Christmas.\n\nEl Chapo was captured in 2016 in Mexico and extradited to America in 2017 on drug charges.\n\nHe was handed a life-sentence in the U.S. <<|needle|>>in 2019, when he was found guilty of a number of criminal charges relating to his leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel. <<|needle|>>He is now serving a life sentence in the ADX Florence supermax prison.\n\nHis sons Ovidio, Jesús Alfredo and Ivan Archivaldo Guzmán, known as ‘Los Chapitos’ or ‘the little Chapos’, have reportedly taken over leadership of the cartel since his incarceration.This is the first of a series of articles looking at the individual scenarios of Arkham Horror The Card Game, starting with the Dunwich Legacy expansion. <<|needle|>>These are my impressions after playing through the scenario at least once and will be focusing on the mechanics and how those reinforce the story elements of a given scenario. <<|needle|>>These articles will contain extensive spoilers and assume a familiarity with the terms and mechanics of the game. <<|needle|>>Please do not read on if you have not played the scenario in the title yet.\n\nIf this is your first contact with the Arkham Horror LCG I would recommend starting off with this beginner's guide on my site.\n\nThe Dunwich legacy kicks off with your old friend Professor Armitage asking you to investigate the disappearance of two of his colleagues. <<|needle|>>Professor Warren Rice was last seen in the humanities department of Miskatonic University and Dr. <<|needle|>>Francis Morgan is a gambler last seen at the Clover Club speakeasy downtown.\n\nThe first clever bit begins before you even start your game with these scenarios. <<|needle|>>You can do these scenarios in either order and the order will change how each scenario plays out. <<|needle|>>In the case of doing Extra- Curricular activity first you use the ‘Faculty office -The Night is Still Young’ card. <<|needle|>>That can’t be good. <<|needle|>>I’ll cover the difference that makes later but for now let’s go to school!\n\nStarting at the Quad you have a choice of places to head to: Library, Humanities Building, Science building, Administration building and the Student Union. <<|needle|>>Your Agenda will tick over at 7 doom and your act at 3 clues per Investigator. <<|needle|>>Both push you towards finding the professor and remind you that he was last seen at the Humanities Building. <<|needle|>>There are lots of nice little touches to the locations as you move around: the Library is harder to investigate, the Science Building is full of dangerous things that can hurt you. <<|needle|>>Subtle mechanics that reinforce the flavour of the location, excellent work.Once you’ve nosed about a bit, it becomes clear that there are more buildings to search: the Science Building, Student Union and Humanities Building revealing an Alchemy Lab, Dormitory and Faculty Office attached to each respectively. <<|needle|>>However, you can’t get into these secondary locations, as each one tells you you cannot enter it: “The door leading into the (location name) is locked. <<|needle|>>You cannot move into the (location name). <<|needle|>>The resolution of the first act has the students telling you to seek out Jazz, the Janitor, who has keys. <<|needle|>>You shuffle this gentleman into the encounter deck along with all the encounter cards discarded so far.Act 2 gives you the ability to spend a clue and discard encounter cards and Jazz has a revelation ability that fires if he gets discarded, popping into play to be brought into your team. <<|needle|>>This is a fantastic little mechanic and really feels like you are frantically searching for the guy as the Agenda ticks up! (Hint: he is always at the bottom of the deck!) Once you have him alongside you ‘Ignore the text on each unrevealed Miskatonic location’ meaning that those locations that were locked earlier, are now accessible! Lovely flavour from a very simple idea.By the time you have found Jazz it’s likely that there has been a commotion from the Science buildings and ‘something’ is on the loose terrorising the campus. <<|needle|>>This big hulking monster called‘The Experiment’ is on the loose and you have limited time as it makes it’s way towards where all the delicious students are hiding.The order you have done the scenarios in also affects the way the Agenda deck advances. <<|needle|>>If you are doing Extra-Curricular Activity first, then you advance to Agenda 2 as normal. <<|needle|>>However if you have visited the Clover Club first then you go straight to Agenda 2b which is the back of Agenda 2, something I hadn’t realised at first. <<|needle|>>This means that you shoot through 2 Agendas at once and move straight to Agenda 3! This gives a great feeling of time passing for the world you are in, making it feel like a living, breathing story.\n\nOnce you have Jazz, Act 2 advances and the Alchemy labs reveals itself if it had not done so already and the Experiment makes himself known if not already out and about thinking about tasty student kibble. <<|needle|>>As for Agenda 2, the order you have done things in matters here, with an extra piece of assistance in the form of an‘Alchemical Concoction’ appearing in the labs if you have been to the Clover Club first. <<|needle|>>This can be used to hurt ‘The Experiment’ if you can sneak past it and grab it!The final Act instructs you to achieve an objective on one of the other cards in play, but what could this mean? Heading to the locked buildings you find two objectives: one on the Faculty offices, if the Night is Young, and one on the Dormitories both of which will give you a resolution. <<|needle|>>You could try and tackle the beast as well and all three give a different outcome. <<|needle|>>However the important thing here is, and I am so glad they are doing this sort of storytelling, is you can’t do it all. <<|needle|>>You have to make a choice and there will be consequences. <<|needle|>>Great stuff.<image>On top of this difficult choice, that you don’t really realise is difficult until the Resolution is reached, you will find yourself with only one real choice if you headed to find the degenerate gambler professor first. <<|needle|>>If ‘The Hour is Late’ version of the Faculty Offices is in play then you are simply too late to help Professor Rice and you will have to see if you can help out those poor students instead (you could just run away and leave them to their fate!).\n\nI find these ‘point of no return’ design choices really interesting as in a lot of computer games I find them kind of annoying, if inevitable if the designer is trying to tell a story. <<|needle|>>However I rarely play computer games like that more than once whereas here it won’t take long to play through the scenario again to try a different path. <<|needle|>>Baked in replayability like this is one of the reasons I have come to really admire this design!\n\nI thought with each of these breakdowns I would look at the Encounter deck separately. <<|needle|>>There is a lot of room to play with the possible encounters in a scenario and Dunwich shows straight out of the gate how much they are willing to change things up.\n\nThroughout the core set the designers didn’t really play with the encounter deck very much, with the horrors inside being the sort of thing you might expect from dabbling in strange cults and things that go bump in the night. <<|needle|>>With Dunwich they have really rolled out the red carpet and shown how clever they can be.\n\nWhen I first started playing this scenario we got hit by a couple of cards that ‘milled’, or discarded, cards from our player decks. <<|needle|>>Not so bad I thought. <<|needle|>>When we turned over the first Agenda we found we took some horror depending on the number of cards we had discarded, but we could take it!\n\nHowever, as the scenario progressed we saw the ‘Beyond the Veil‘ card and suddenly it dawned on us just how devastating this could get. <<|needle|>>Sure there were some monsters to deal with but the real harm came from losing all our useful cards and having the threat of exploding when we ran out of cards. <<|needle|>>Most characters will not be in a situation to be able to suck up 10 damage at once, so this puts a real feeling of a timer on the game, on top of the already ticking Doom counter. <<|needle|>>Nicely done gents.On top of the new encounter sets used in this scenario I was heartened to see them reusing the core sets as well, showing a willingness to mix and match different sets to create a unique encounter. <<|needle|>>I look forward to them really playing with this as the game expands, thought it might mean an individual scenario becomes a little hard to setup as you have to search through for the various sets that make it up.\n\nThere we have it, my first behind the scenes look at the scenarios of Arkham Horror. <<|needle|>>I remain incredibly impressed by the design team on this one, they are showing a real elegance in their choices that I don’t often see from FFG. <<|needle|>>Long may it continue.\n\nDiscuss this article\nLog in to comment\nPosts in discussion: Beyond the Veil – The Arkham Horror Card Game: Dunwich Legacy - Extracurricular Activity\n\nDarthJoJo replied the topic: #300085 26 Jul 2019 10:21\nI actually find Extracurricular Activities one of the weaker scenarios in this campaign. <<|needle|>>Not that it does anything wrong, but that it doesn't really do anything to stand out. <<|needle|>>That's okay. <<|needle|>>Dunwich is probably the best first buy after the core box and shouldn't need to go crazy complex yet, but Extracurricular is less exciting on return plays.\n\nThe strongest elements here are probably the RPG-type stuff: you begin the campaign by picking your starting scenario and the three distinct victory conditions in Extracurricular. <<|needle|>>You have real choices, and they have real consequences, limited as they may be in order to make the rest of the campaign happen.\n\nOne complaint I do have, and this comes up several times in the first half of the campaign, is that the presence of the monsters doesn't really make sense. <<|needle|>>Yeah, the Dunwich folk are trying to kidnap Armitage and his friends, but the Experiment isn't their doing, is it? Miskatonic University apparently has an Alchemical Department, and the Experiment was something that just happened to go wrong while you were walking around. <<|needle|>>On the macro level, I think the campaign narrative of Dunwich is one of the strongest alongside Forgotten Age: this happens, so the investigators do this. <<|needle|>>Armitage fears someone wants to steal the Necronomicon, so the investigators need to find it first. <<|needle|>>Makes way more sense than some of the leaps you make in Circle Undone. <<|needle|>>Witches are bothering Arkham? Well, there are a lot of accused witches buried in the graveyard. <<|needle|>>Let's spend the night there. <<|needle|>>Unfortunately the story within the Dunwich scenarios doesn't always make as much sense.Dialogic design and systems thinking can be closely related, although not everyone appreciates the ties. <<|needle|>> For the Design with Dialogue community, at the invitation of Peter Jones, we jointly organized a workshop based on some ideas that I had previously brought together in teaching in Finland. <<|needle|>> I’ve posted the slides — both with builds and as printable — over on the Coevolving Commons. <<|needle|>> For people who weren’t there, I can provide an outline of the activities of the three hours.\n\nAfter introducing ourselves in the circle, and speaking about dialogues that each of us might be interested in pursuing, I provided an explanation of the Map of Ignorance, as described in the Curriculum on Medical Ignorance by Witte, Kerwin and Witte in the University of Arizona College of Medicine. <<|needle|>> We walked through the interpretation of Unknown Knowns, Known Unknowns, and Errors.\n\nTaboos and denials typically don’t enter a dialogue unless the facilitator ensures that they do.\n\nQuestions of knowledge bring us to conceptions of science, related to scientific revolutions, whereby a quick outline of Thomas Kuhn and paradigm shifts was described. <<|needle|>> This led to a discussion of mainstream science and post-normal science, following the work of Jerome Ravetz. <<|needle|>> The combination of systems uncertainty and decision stakes might lead us to approaches based on applied science (e.g. <<|needle|>>engineering), professional consultancy (e.g. <<|needle|>>scientists) or post-normal science (e.g. <<|needle|>>dialogic design)Attendees broke out into six groups. <<|needle|>> From the predispositions individuals had outlined in the circle introductions, each group quickly chose a dialogue of focus for design. <<|needle|>> They were asked to (i) create a quick map of ignorance for the topic, and (ii) discuss how the dialogue might be approached in the frame of mainstream science or post-normal science.\n\nReturning to the circle, the second set of explanations was around the design of inquiring systems, as originally developed by C. <<|needle|>>West Churchman, with more concrete descriptions by Mitroff and Linstone. <<|needle|>> Stories helped to differentiate four ways of knowing, as (i) inductive-consensual, (ii) analytic deductive, (iii) multiple realities, and (iv) dialectic.A fifth way of knowing, a multiple perspectives systems approach, was presented as a challenge, sweeping in the four other inquiring systems. <<|needle|>> For some attendees who were interested in business applications, I mentioned that Vince Barabba had described a multiple perspectives systems approach in Meeting of the Minds, and has recently published a new book The Decision Loom.Participants returned to their groups to discuss what types of inquiring system(s) might be appropriate for the dialogues they were designing.\n\nWe closed down the Design with Dialogue session a little bit later than usual, as all groups seemed to want to continue working. <<|needle|>> There was a question as whether we had covered all of systems thinking or part of it. <<|needle|>> Inquiring systems are only one part of the larger body of knowledge in systems thinking. <<|needle|>> Perhaps we’ll look to schedule some more systems thinking sessions relevant to dialogue designers in the future.Home » Weaving through the Kinks; A Natural hair day at Brooklyn College\n\nWeaving through the Kinks; A Natural hair day at Brooklyn College\n\nYesterday Brooklyn College held its 2nd annual Women of Color and Identity Conference in the Gold Room of the Student Center. <<|needle|>>Men, women, natural, relaxed and weaved heads came together to discuss the topic of Black hair from different angles.\n\nFirst on the agenda was the Going Natural Video Diaries, my documentary that pictures the natural hair movement in motion. <<|needle|>>The half an hour feature opened up the dialogue on the day’s theme: Weaving through the Kinks.\n\nThe whole goal of my documentary is to capture the natural hair movement while it’s happening to see how we as a people connect, how we relate and what transitioning to natural hair teaches us.\n\nSo after the film, even before the audience got a chance to ask me questions, I opened up the floor and asked the students if and how they could relate to the hair stories shared in the Video Diaries.\n\nThe first things one of the young women said was the two texture struggle and the breakage while going natural. <<|needle|>>Now that is one of the simple practical things that connects us because everyone goes though this while  transitioning  and it was good to see how all of us could relate to it.Students having a good time!\n\nIt wasn’t a one way conversation though, the audience was very engaged and so smart before I knew it I was answering their questions and talking about my own journey. <<|needle|>>I guess that’s what you get when you go to colleges.\n\nWhen I answered that I thought that it is the mental part of transitioning that is the hardest part of going natural, Brigitte Turner Actress, Model and Filmmaker backed me up with a story that got everyone quite for a second. <<|needle|>>A woman told Brigitte that her husband left her when she took off her wig.The Going Natural Giveaway for the Day.\n\nAs you can imagine it stirred up the conversation and brought it to yet another level. <<|needle|>>We could have gone on and on but it was time for the next topics on the agenda: Lurie Daniel Favor’s Keynote speech followed by performances and panel discussions.\n\nBy now you probably know that Lurie, the nappy headed lawyer, as I call her, is one of my favorite people. <<|needle|>>Not just because the picture I took of her inspired her to write Afro State of Mind which definitely makes me incredibly proud but it’s way more than that. <<|needle|>>It’s because Lurie is super smart, very passionate, very well spoken, has an incredible head of 4C hair and is gorgeously looking and in spirit on top of that.As expected Lurie’s spirited presentation got everyone exited. <<|needle|>>She inspired students while answering their questions then before you know it, it was time for the Steppers and the Slam poetry performances.\n\nAll performances were fantastic as was the food that had arrived. <<|needle|>>The cozy yet inspiring environment was a huge contrast to the cold and rainy outside. <<|needle|>>I was so happy to be there, to be invited. <<|needle|>>Organizer Benewaa did a phenomenal job putting the event together.\n\nAn all male panel of five from a loced head to a bald headed one, did a good job answering questions from hairstyle preferences to stereotyping gender roles in relationships. <<|needle|>>What stood out for me was the man in the middle who explained that he had to get used to the natural look because he wasn’t exposed to it. <<|needle|>>That is something that a few men also state in the Going Natural Video Diaries.\n\nThe all female panel was last on the program with familiar faces from the natural hair world. <<|needle|>>Diane Bailey, one of the first to open a natural hair salon in Brooklyn,  Karen Tappin, owner of Karen’s Body Beautiful who also sponsored gift bags, Brigitte Turner  and Janel Stewart, from her Kinky Curly Coily blog with her adorable little daughter.\n\nThese smart passionate women made the audience laugh and gasp at the same time, answering questions from basic hair care to the lack of cultural awareness beyond black follicles.\n\nWhat stood out for me was Karen sharing the story of a straight hair woman who just could not understand what all the fuzz about Black hair was all about. <<|needle|>>When the owner of Karen’s Body Beautiful asked the woman to imagine that she and her would be rejected at work and in school just because they had straight hair, the woman just dismissed it as a crazy idea.\n\nThis story made me realize once again that while we are making progress and we’re having fun doing it, we still got a long way to go.<image>On the first day of the International Seminar for Sambo Judges in Cyprus the participants mostly listened to the lecturers and took notes, and on the second day they actively participated in the learning process. <<|needle|>>The first part of the day was devoted to the analysis of disputable situations from various tournaments captured on video. <<|needle|>>The afternoon became the main challenge for the judges as they took exams. <<|needle|>>How is the language barrier at the seminar overcome? Is it difficult to change the status of an athlete for the status of a judge and cooperate with the referees who judged you before? Why is Sambo more difficult for referees than other types of martial arts? Read the answers to these and other questions in the FIAS website reportage from Agros.\n\nThe seminar was attended by judges from more than 20 countries. <<|needle|>>It took someone a long time to get to Agros, Cyprus, someone did not spend a lot of time for travelling, but the easiest way to the venue of the seminar was for Cypriots. <<|needle|>>Athlete, beginner in coaching and debuting judge George Eliseos from Cyprus told us about his career:“I’ve been practicing Sambo and performing as an athlete for 8 years already, and now I want to pursue a career as a judge and coach. <<|needle|>>I have little experience in coaching – together with my coach I teach Sambo to children in our club. <<|needle|>>And when my coach asked me if I wanted to take part in the international seminar for judges, I, of course, said \"Yes!\" immediately. <<|needle|>>This is a great opportunity to gain new experience and become a part of the FIAS team. <<|needle|>>During two days of training we discussed a lot of different interesting situations. <<|needle|>>I’m not sure I've seen so much throughout my Sambo career. <<|needle|>>Now I watch the competition not as a participant of fights, I take a detached view and assess everything that is happening on the mat as a referee. <<|needle|>>Besides the fact that we get a lot of information from the lecturers of the seminar, we gain a lot of experience by communicating with participants from other countries. <<|needle|>>Everywhere Sambo has its own peculiarities, and I’m very pleased that communication among participants from different countries is taking place in Cyprus, my home country”, George Eliseos says.\n\nIn contrast, Dane De Rose from the United States had a 14-hour flight to participate in the seminar for judges. <<|needle|>>He has first-hand knowledge of sports, coaching and refereeing career:“I started practicing Sambo in 1980, when a group of Sambo athletes from the USSR came to our country and “infected” us with their love to this sport. <<|needle|>>We all wanted to learn and understand Sambo, because this martial art seemed to us a real secret at that time. <<|needle|>>After my sports career was over, I started to train American Sambo athletes and accompanied the USA team at major international tournaments. <<|needle|>>Now I’ve been working hard as a referee, and I hope to receive a FIAS certificate after the seminar.\n\nWhen I came to the seminar I had an impression that no one really knows each other, but then we began to get acquainted, and it was very nice when people remembered my name and turned to me. <<|needle|>>Of course, at the beginning there was the language barrier, but we had a great interpreter who speaks perfect English. <<|needle|>>He helps us both during classes and after them, so there’s absolutely no problem. <<|needle|>>Of course, I was a bit nervous before the final test, but I was self-confident. <<|needle|>>I trained hard, because I had a chance to get an international FIAS license”, Dane De Rose says.\n\ntorgom ovanesyan representing France accumulated rich Sambo experience as well. <<|needle|>>He said that he was actively restoring previously accumulated knowledge and was ready to take up a career as a judge with renewed vigour:“Firstly, we communicate with colleagues a lot at the seminar, and secondly, we get much information on how to work at competitions. <<|needle|>>Previously, I worked as a referee in Armenia, and 12 years ago I moved to France, and I was away from these activities for some time. <<|needle|>>But not so long ago he became interested in judging Sambo competitions again. <<|needle|>>France holds a lot of tournaments both among adults and youth. <<|needle|>>We have two extra class judges and three international referees. <<|needle|>>What do I think of the seminar? It’s great! The presentation of information, the participants, and the atmosphere of the seminar are just wonderful. <<|needle|>>Today, we have analysed situations from different tournaments recorded on video, which was a difficult task. <<|needle|>>Sometimes I was able to give the correct answer, sometimes I was wrong, but it helps to learn and improve one’s skills. <<|needle|>>After examination of disputable situations at the seminar, each of us will be able to clearly resolve these moments at competitions. <<|needle|>>The second day of the seminar ends with an exam. <<|needle|>>I carefully prepared for it, both at home, and here. <<|needle|>>That’s why, despite a little excitement, I’m sure everything will be fine”, torgom ovanesyan radiates his optimism.\n\nSambo and Judo amateurs are well aware of such a name as Angela Polevaya-Sakereanu. <<|needle|>>The representative of Moldova repeatedly occupied the podium at major international competitions. <<|needle|>>Now she is working shoulder to shoulder with the people who judged fights in which she participated:“I’ve been at the national level for a long time, and I have recently made my debut at the international one, the European Sambo Championship in Bucharest in 2014. <<|needle|>>The first international refereeing was followed by the first international seminar. <<|needle|>>I’m going to continue this practice in the future. <<|needle|>>I’ve practiced Sambo as an athlete for a long time, and I’m a double world champion among students, as well as nine times World and European Sambo medalist. <<|needle|>>I’ve always wanted to attend a Sambo seminar, so I took advantage of the opportunity when it offered.\n\nI liked the lesson with video analysis, in which we were asked to properly assess technical actions of Sambo athletes. <<|needle|>>As wishes for the future, I would like to get more detailed information about the work of secretaries, because it’s quite a difficult activity. <<|needle|>>What concerns other moments, everything is fine. <<|needle|>>The venue is wonderful. <<|needle|>>I know many participants of the seminar since the 1990’s, because at that time I fought at World and European Sambo Championships. <<|needle|>>The change of the status of an athlete for the one of a judge is not given immediately, but the most important thing is like in the fight, i.e. <<|needle|>>to act and start judging. <<|needle|>>And then everything happens without your efforts. <<|needle|>>Especially, I like judging both sport and combat sambo. <<|needle|>>I worked at various fights at European Championships”, Angela Polevaya-Sakereanu says.\n\nRefereeing at the highest level is not new to Anatoli Khalkadarov representing Austria. <<|needle|>>Despite the fact that he judged a large number of athletes, there are many nuances in Sambo that need to be learned anew:“I started as a child and tried my hand in almost all types of martial arts. <<|needle|>>My first sport was Kurash, then I switched to freestyle wrestling, then to Greco-Roman wrestling (it was called classical at that time), then I was keen on judo, sambo, and belt wrestling. <<|needle|>>Now I teach Sambo to kids in Vienna. <<|needle|>>I’m also an international FILA judge. <<|needle|>>I’ve been working in the international arena and judging at European and World Championships for more than 25 years. <<|needle|>>This is the first time I’m attending a Sambo seminar. <<|needle|>>Previously I participated in many sport wrestling and judo seminars. <<|needle|>>The organisers have prepared a very good program in Agros for us, so we will benefit from the knowledge received.\n\nEvery sport has its own nuances. <<|needle|>>Sport wrestling is an Olympic sport, and Sambo is only trying to become a member of the Olympic family. <<|needle|>>Of course, it would be great if Sambo participated in the main Games every four years. <<|needle|>>Sambo, I think, is more an applied sport that can really provide a person self-defense. <<|needle|>>In terms of judging Sambo, this sport is a bit more difficult than other types of wrestling. <<|needle|>>This applies at least to those that I practiced. <<|needle|>>It’s simpler and easier to judge sport wrestling, as there are not so many nuances like in Sambo. <<|needle|>>Some of my colleagues were really nervous before the exam. <<|needle|>>I think it’s not important to pass the exam. <<|needle|>>It’s important to know the rules, apply them properly and evaluate athletes. <<|needle|>>And exams can always been retaken”, Anatoli Khalkadarov shares his worldly wisdom.\n\nAs always, experienced Sambo judge Emin Rashi from Georgia was one of the most active participants of the seminar for judges. <<|needle|>>He managed not only to receive information, ask questions, joke, but also carefully explained various nuances to his colleagues, helping them to better understand Sambo:“I’ve acted as a judge at fifteen world championships, but I believe that each seminar provides new knowledge. <<|needle|>>We need to learn and improve our skills, because nothing stands still, and life is constantly changing. <<|needle|>>The seminar is followed by the Youth Championship and the World Sambo Championship, so we need to get ready for the events. <<|needle|>>I’m very pleased that a lot of young guys attended this seminar. <<|needle|>>It's great that they are also involved and want to get to know the rules, and then to work at major international Sambo competitions. <<|needle|>>I think when young referees learn from experienced judges, both benefit from the process. <<|needle|>>By the way, there are three representatives from Georgia, i.e. <<|needle|>>I, as the Chairman of the Panel of Judges, as well as two young referees. <<|needle|>>After each class with lecturers, we gather together and analyse different situations. <<|needle|>>If they don’t understand something during the lectures, I try to thoroughly explain it to them in an understandable form, so that they could pass the exam successfully. <<|needle|>>And, of course, I worried a bit before the test, but mainly for the guys”, Emin Rashi says.\n\nChairman of the FIAS Panel of Judges Eugene Selivanov summed up the seminar:“We have held a two-day seminar for judges. <<|needle|>>It helped us to define the list of arbiters, who will work at the Youth Championship and the World Sambo Championship. <<|needle|>>The seminar brought together more than 50 referees from 22 countries. <<|needle|>>After two days of classes, we held an examination, and those who passed it received certificates. <<|needle|>>As a result, we will form a team of judges who will work at major competitions. <<|needle|>>Until the end of the year we have 5 planned major international tournaments. <<|needle|>>I am sure we will cope with it”, Eugene Selivanov looks into the future with confidence.\n\n[Photogallery] International Workshop for Sambo

‘what if?’\n\nNick Saban ditching the NFL for Alabama makes for one an epic \"what if?\" scenario in coaching history. <<|needle|>>Let's look back at why Saban left the Miami Dolphins.\n\nAlabama head coach Nick Saban abruptly left the NFL before arriving in Tuscaloosa, and the story behind his departure from the Miami Dolphins is absolutely fascinating.\n\nSaban didn’t fare poorly in the pros to the point where he was fired. <<|needle|>>He left on his own volition after only two seasons, quickly realizing his style was better suited for the college game.\n\nAnd who can argue with him? Saban helped build up Michigan State’s football program, and won a national championship at LSU before returning to the NFL gridiron. <<|needle|>>His tenure at Alabama has been nothing short of legendary, with six national titles to date.\n\nSaban didn’t lack pro experience prior to his stint with the Dolphins, though. <<|needle|>>He’d served two seasons in the late 80s as a Houston Oilers defensive backs coach, and was Bill Belichick’s defensive coordinator on the Cleveland Browns for four seasons.So, what ultimately led Saban to decide that the NCAA was best for him? We’ll look at three big reasons why, and break down what might’ve happened if Saban stuck with the NFL.\n\n1. <<|needle|>>‘The Process’ didn’t translate to the pros\n\nSaban’s “Process” involves him being a grating, meticulous disciplinarian whose no-nonsense approach and sky-high standards draw the absolute best out of his players.\n\nThis has worked wonders for Saban at Alabama but wasn’t as translatable to the NFL. <<|needle|>>Why? Well, Saban has developed an impeccable reputation at the college level. <<|needle|>>He also recruits many of the best prospects in the country to come play for him. <<|needle|>>Many of these young men aspire to be in the NFL and know they’ll optimize their chances by playing for Saban in Tuscaloosa.\n\nBut an NFL locker room is an entirely different matter. <<|needle|>>These are grown men, and veterans who know what it takes to be a successful pro don’t need Saban constantly on their case or lecturing them. <<|needle|>>It was clear when Saban posted a 15-17 record that his message wasn’t quite getting through in Miami.\n\nHowever, Saban leaving the NFL was a little more complicated than “The Process” not having the same magic at a higher level of football. <<|needle|>>His teams still bought in enough to go on some impressive winning streaks of six his first season and four in his second.\n\nAlthough he won his NFL coaching debut in 2005, Saban wasn’t exactly accustomed to losing after a 48-16 tenure at LSU. <<|needle|>>In fact, he’d never posted a losing record in a single season.\n\nThe losses piled up in Saban’s maiden NFL campaign, though, as the Dolphins stumbled to a 3-7 record. <<|needle|>>Then, something extraordinary happened: They rattled off six straight victories to close out the slate, and their 9-7 mark left them just outside the playoff picture.\n\nBecause of that exceptional finish, there was optimism that Miami’s program was moving in the right direction. <<|needle|>>Unfortunately, a similar situation unfolded in 2006, only worse. <<|needle|>>The Fins started 1-6, rebounded with four straight wins, but finished 6-10 overall.\n\nTwo consecutive bad starts and regression in Year 2 gave Saban serious second thoughts about the NFL. <<|needle|>>He was linked to the Alabama coaching vacancy and had to publicly answer questions about the Crimson Tide’s rumored interest in him before Miami’s season even ended.\n\nAfter several public denials that he’d wind up at Alabama, as it turned out, Saban met with the school’s leadership on New Year’s Day 2007 and accepted the Tide’s head coaching job two days later.\n\n3. <<|needle|>>Bad quarterback play and missing out on Drew Brees\n\nEven when the Fins went 9-7 under Saban, they had freaking Gus Frerotte at quarterback. <<|needle|>>He’s more famous for injuring himself on a celebratory headbutt than anything else. <<|needle|>>Frerotte went 9-6 as a starter in 2005 despite completing 52% of his passes and logging a 71.9 passer rating.\n\nTalk about a phenomenal coaching effort by Saban.\n\nBefore you jump all over Saban for leaving the Dolphins, bear in mind that during his final year, instead of trotting out his desired quarterback in Drew Brees, Miami went with a combination of a past-his-prime Daunte Culpepper, draft bust Joey Harrington and Cleo Lemon. <<|needle|>>It’s a wonder they managed to win six games in 2006.\n\nAs recently as April 2020 on The Dan Patrick Show, Saban opened the old wound about missing out on Brees, who was a free agent prior to Saban’s second season in Miami, per Saturday Down South:\n\nOur first choice was to take Drew Brees. <<|needle|>>The medical people made that decision (to pass on Brees) relative to Drew Brees’ shoulder, his situation, it was his throwing arm. <<|needle|>>[…] That was a medical decision, it was not an organizational decision. <<|needle|>>You know, we wanted to take Drew Brees, he’s the first guy that we brought in, he’s the first guy that we made a deal with. <<|needle|>>But it was a medical issue that created that.\n\nNick Saban on the medical concerns regarding Drew Brees\n\nInstead of signing Brees like Saban wanted, the Dolphins went with Daunte Culpepper. <<|needle|>>Team doctors had failed Brees’ physical, and he wound up going to the New Orleans Saints. <<|needle|>>Brees led them to the NFC Championship Game in his first year, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nIn an article by The Advocate, you can get a sense of how Brees felt about Saban and the Dolphins organization:\n\n“I have a lot of respect for Coach Saban…I felt like he was honest with me when I was down there. <<|needle|>>But I felt like when I was here in New Orleans, I was embraced. <<|needle|>>I was given confidence that, ‘You’re our guy, and we know the situation you’re in but we know you’re going to come back and lead this team and this community.’ The impression I got when I was (in Miami) was, ‘Hey, we like you, but we’re not sure.’ I got the sense I was being evaluated every second I was there.”\n\nDrew Brees on choosing Saints over Dolphins in free agency\n\nThat just makes matters worse for Dolphins fans. <<|needle|>>They’re hoping that Saban’s former Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa evolves into the long-term answer under center they’ve coveted since Dan Marino retired. <<|needle|>>Brees could’ve been that guy, and had Miami signed him, Saban might still be there.What if Nick Saban had stayed in the NFL?\n\nWell, it’s hard to know. <<|needle|>>The Brees scenario is its own alternate timeline/parallel universe in which we could’ve seen the QB and Saban combine to win multiple Super Bowls. <<|needle|>>Think about it: Brees’ uncanny accuracy, historic passing production and leadership combined with Saban’s defensive genius. <<|needle|>>What a combo it could’ve been.\n\nIf Alabama hadn’t made Saban such a crazy offer — at the time, an eight-year contract worth $32 million was absolutely bonkers — maybe he would’ve stuck it out in Miami. <<|needle|>>Otherwise, maybe another organization would’ve taken a chance on him.\n\nIt’s quite possible that Saban would’ve returned to be Belichick’s defensive coordinator on the New England Patriots, but then again, maybe he wouldn’t want to take a step down.\n\nAs it turned out, that NFL offseason opened up tons of fascinating coaching vacancies around the league.<image>The Pittsburgh Steelers hired Mike Tomlin to succeed Bill Cowher, a 31-year-old Lane Kiffin — who was Saban’s offensive coordinator from 2014 to 2016 — landed the Raiders’ gig, and the Chargers replaced the late, great Marty Schottenheimer with Norv Turner despite posting a 14-2 record the year before.\n\nAlso, the Dallas Cowboys were in the market for a new coach once Bill Parcells retired.\n\nImagine if Saban followed Cowher in Pittsburgh. <<|needle|>>Or beat out Kiffin to lead the Silver and Black. <<|needle|>>Or if he got the chance to coach the Bolts during LaDainian Tomlinson’s prime. <<|needle|>>Oh yeah, and Saban could’ve had a crack at coaching the Cowboys.\n\nThree of those franchises are unmistakably iconic, and the Chargers, at the time, probably had the best collection of talent in the NFL.\n\nAgain, the “what if?” possibilities of what would’ve happened if Saban had stayed in the NFL are mind-blowing. <<|needle|>>At least in his case, everything worked out for the best, because he’s now regarded as arguably the best college football coach ever.In Psychedelic Therapy, The “Mystical Experience” Could Be Key\n\nIn a study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, researchers found that psychedelic therapy involving controlled microdosing of the drug psilocybin failed to relieve symptoms associated with anxiety or depression.\n\nResults of the placebo-controlled study cast doubt on the claimed benefits of psilocybin microdosing. <<|needle|>>However, study co-author and current Ph.D. <<|needle|>>candidate at the University of Konstanz, George Fejer, says the negligible impact of microdosing does not mean psychedelic therapy should be dismissed.\n\nInstead, past research suggests dosage, or more importantly, the subjective “mystical experience” brought on by altered states of consciousness, could be vital in unlocking the therapeutic potential of psychedelics.\n\n“The consensus [is] you need the subjective effects, or the altered states of consciousness, to get the full and enduring benefits from these drugs,” said Fejer in an interview with The Debrief. <<|needle|>>“These effects are quite dose-specific, and I think that it is a disadvantage of microdosing that it does not aim to facilitate explicit changes in subjective experience.Psychedelics have had a major impact on Cognitive Science\n\nIn the United States, psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), are considered Schedule I Controlled Substances, meaning the compounds possess “significant potential for abuse and dependence” and “no recognized medicinal value.”\n\nIn light of their current legal status, Fejer points out that psychedelics have played a significant role in cognitive science and in furthering our understanding of human consciousness.\n\n“I think the biggest impact of psychedelics on the study of consciousness took place in the 1960s by introducing the idea that complex behaviors are subject to chemical events that take place in the brain,” said Fejer. <<|needle|>>“These insights are ubiquitous nowadays, but they used to be unheard of in the field of psychiatry.\n\n“The discovery of LSD demonstrated that tiny chemical interventions can cause profound changes to our mental state, and psychiatrists re-evaluated the foundations of mental disease. <<|needle|>>Research on LSD also led to discovering the role of serotonin in the brain, and many other neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, adrenaline, and dopamine.”\n\nThe discovery that complex behaviors result from chemical changes in the brain helped establish the field of consciousness research, a discipline Fejer says wasn’t taken seriously until the mid-1990s.\n\n“The term consciousness or any other subjective experiences were considered too wishy-washy to be studied scientifically, and even fields\n\nlike emotion research suffered from the stigma,” explained Fejer.\n\nNow, consciousness study is accepted as a serious field, and in recent years, interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics has become an ever-increasing area of clinical research.\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. <<|needle|>>Federal Drug Administration began granting “Breakthrough Therapy” designation to various research institutes, allowing for the study of psilocybin as a possible therapeutic for significant mood disorders.\n\nSubsequently, several studies have come out in recent years, showing a positive relationship between psychedelics and improved mental health. <<|needle|>>Research has additionally failed to find any evidence for adverse short-term or long-term effects from engaging in psychedelic therapy.Psychedelic Therapy Without the Trip\n\nIn the last decade, the concept of microdosing- or ingestion of 5-10% of the standard dose of a psychedelic substance -has become a buzzword in psychedelic therapy research. <<|needle|>>With microdosing, doses are sufficiently low so as not to produce the hallucinogenic effects typically associated with psychedelics.\n\nHowever, the most significant limitation to scientifically proving the effectiveness of microdosing stems from the bulk of previous studies having to rely on anecdotal reporting and a lack of placebo control groups.\n\nBy contrast, in this recent study, researchers from the University of Amsterdam, Leiden University, and Prague University of Chemistry and Technology performed a double-blind experiment whereby participants were given doses of either psilocybin or placebo pills.\n\nUpon analysis, researchers found no statistically significant difference between psilocybin and placebo groups and users’ symptoms of depression or anxiety.\n\nInterestingly, researchers did note a strong generic placebo effect, showing both the microdosing and placebo groups had significant changes in their overall wellbeing after beginning the study.\n\n“Thus, merely expecting that you are part of a clinical trial during which you might or might not receive a psychoactive substance already improves your wellbeing,” study author Michiel van Elk, an associate professor of cognitive psychology at Leiden University, told Psypost.\n\nGrandmas Really Are The Best Finally Proven By Science\n\nThe study’s findings coincide with another 2016 placebo-controlled study by researchers from John Hopkins and New York University, which demonstrated that low doses of psilocybin failed to reduce depression and anxiety in patients facing life-threatening cancer.\n\nInterestingly, the same study did find that high doses of psilocybin substantially eased symptoms of depression and anxiety and improved the general quality of life in terminal cancer patients. <<|needle|>>Six months after taking high doses of psilocybin, researchers found that 80% of patients still demonstrated sustained improvements in overall mental health.\n\n“This makes intuitive sense because the subjective experience provides a lot of material for the patient and the therapist to build a therapeutic alliance. <<|needle|>>The neurochemical interactions are, of course, a necessary component of their effects because they facilitate altered states of consciousness,” said Fejer.\n\n“These effects are quite dose-specific, and I think that it is a disadvantage of microdosing that it does not aim to facilitate explicit changes in subjective experience. <<|needle|>>Even if we only consider the neurochemical interactions, I think larger doses are more likely to yield positive effects, in which case the experience is a very important therapeutic modality to work with.”The Mystical Experience Is Key\n\n“There is a real risk in promoting the idea that repeated microdosing can yield the same type of benefits as larger doses because different doses evoke different kinds of neurochemical effects,” says Fejer.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean microdosing should be entirely written off. <<|needle|>>At least not yet.\n\n“Research often looks at whether psychedelics improve mental health outcomes by inducing mystical-type experiences. <<|needle|>>Since microdosing does not induce these types of experiences, it is not surprising that they do not yield the same effects,” explains Fejer.\n\n“Research on these issues is still in its infancy, and I think it would be a good idea to look at the advantages of minidoses in terms of tailoring therapy to the needs of patients.”\n\nConsidering that the majority of research suggests altered states of consciousness play such a vital role, Fejer still has doubts that microdosing will ever prove to be an effective option for psychedelic therapy. <<|needle|>>However, Fejer, who also serves as a team coordinator for ALIUS – a French-based interdisciplinary group that focuses on consciousness research- says he’s happy to have his opinion on microdosing proven wrong.\n\n“I am a little bit skeptical about microdosing since I do not think that the current evidence supports the claims of microdosing enthusiasts,” said Fejer. <<|needle|>>“However, I am also open to seeing contradicting evidence, and this applies to our study as well: null results are merely an invitation for other researchers to come up with better experiments and better measurements!”It’s hard to narrow down the best beaches in the Algarve to just six since there are so many candidates.\n\nOn a recent road trip through the south of Spain and across the Algarve I stopped at quite a few.\n\nBut it’s these six that have left a lasting impression on me.\n\nA map of the best beaches in the Algarve\n\nThe map below shows where the six beaches you’ll learn about in this article are located.\n\nDepending on where you are in the Algarve or how far you are willing to travel, you should be able to find somewhere on this list that can fit around your plans.\n\nThe further west you go the more the coastline becomes rugged and weathered.\n\nYou’ll start finding towering cliffs hanging over the beaches as well as stacks and arches out to sea that have been created over the course of many years by the erosive power of the waves.\n\nBut regardless of where you are in the Algarve, the Atlantic coastline is stunningly beautiful.\n\nThe six places you’ll learn about in this article are (in order from west to east):\n\nPraia do Tonel is one of the smaller beaches found in Sagres, the south-westerly tip of Portugal.\n\nBut it’s the long rolling waves paired with the imposing cliffs that make it so beautiful. <<|needle|>>Not to mention being a hot-spot for surfers.If your main aim is to come away with a great photo then it is best to shoot from the top of the cliff looking down.\n\nThe best place, in my opinion, is the cliff where the Fortaleza Sagres (Sagres Fort) sits.\n\nFrom the Fort, Praia do Tonel is in a north-westerly direction. <<|needle|>>Once you have a good look around you’ll be sure to find some great compositions from that vantage point.\n\nCabo de São Vicente is another great location in Sagres to take some photos. <<|needle|>>It’s not strictly a beach though. <<|needle|>>It’s a rough stretch of coastline where the waves smash up against the rocky cliff-face and where a lighthouse sits watching over it all.\n\nThe one problem with shooting photos here?\n\nIt’s so windy you feel as though you are going to be blown off the barrier-free clifftops. <<|needle|>>So be careful and don’t venture too close to the edge!\n\nAgain, this isn’t strictly a beach but you can see why it made the cut.Ponte da Piedade is a group of rock formations mainly made up of stacks and arches just off the coast of Lagos.\n\nIt’s not just the breathtaking rock formations that make Ponta da Piedade such a beautiful place though. <<|needle|>>The surrounding waters are crystal clear.\n\nThe number one things to do in this area is to join a Kayak tour that takes you in and around the stacks and arches. <<|needle|>>It isn’t the cheapest activity, but totally worth it.A kayak tour will last around 2-2.5 hours and will cost about €35 per person. <<|needle|>>You’ll be in a group of around 15-20 other people all being lead by a local guide.\n\nIf you would prefer to explore the rock formations by boat then there is an option to do that as well.\n\nYou can pre-book online which will save you some money. <<|needle|>>To do so, check out the tours listed below.\n\nYou may also like: Olhão Is A Sleepy Portuguese Fishing Town Full Of Stunning Street Art\n\nPortimão is a popular holiday destination with foreign and Portuguese tourists alike. <<|needle|>>So you might think that, like many tourist hotspots, the beaches might be a sunbed and umbrella utopia.\n\nBut you’d be wrong.The beaches in and around Portimão boast clean, fine yellow sand that is almost powder-like and the familiar rock formations found all over in the west of the Algarve.\n\nIf you are looking out to sea on Praia Tres Castelos then right at the far end of the beach, to the left, you’ll find the arch that is pictured above.\n\nIt’s a great place to capture some photos during golden hour since the setting sun perfectly baths the arch in beautifully defused light.\n\nIt’s also not a bad place to sit and watch the sun dip below the horizon whilst sipping on a local Sagres beer if that’s more your style.\n\nPraia de Benagil is special because, not only is it one of the best beaches in the Algarve itself, but it’s right next to the Benagil Caves.\n\nThese amazing caves can be accessed in three different ways.\n\nFirst, you can rent a kayak or stand-up paddleboard and paddle your way there directly from the beach. <<|needle|>>This way you can enter the cave, pull right up to the shore and get out to explore in your own time.\n\nSecond, you can take a boat tour from nearby Portimão if that’s where you are based since there isn’t much in Benagil apart from the beach and caves and you don’t have your own transport.\n\nThe third option is to swim there from the Benagil beach. <<|needle|>>I personally swam there since it’s not too far. <<|needle|>>But I do not recommend it if you’re not comfortable in deep water and not a strong swimmer. <<|needle|>>I actually swam it twice so it’s very doable, but I saw some people who looked like they wished they had just rented a kayak. <<|needle|>>It can be wavy, there is a current and the water is extremely cold.\n\nOnce you get inside the cave though, however you get there, it’s a sight to behold.\n\nPraia da Marinha is right next to Praia de Benagil, just a 1.9km drive or walk away.\n\nIt’s considered to be in the top 10 most beautiful beaches in the whole of Europe by the Michelin Guide, one of the best beaches in the world by CNN and was awarded the Golden Beach award by the Portuguese Ministry of the Environment.\n\nIt’s most recent accolade is that, in 2015, it was officially named one of the best destinations in Europe by European Best Destinations.\n\nAnd it’s easy to see why this beach is held in such high regard.<image>The picture-perfect beach has made its way into many tv adverts and promotional posters for the Algarve because of its pristine waters, white sand and impressive rock formations.\n\nBoth Praia da Marinha and Praia de Benagil can be visited in one day since they are so close to each other and that’s what I recommend you do.\n\nYou could even walk between the two if you felt up for the 1.9km hike. <<|needle|>>Just know that some parts are uphill if you walk from Benagil to Praia da Marinha, so bear that in mind.\n\nFinally, we come to the last beach on this list and the most easterly, right next to the Spanish border.\n\nYou won’t find the rock formations, stacks and arches that are common in the west of the Algarve here.\n\nThe beach in the small town of Monte Gordo is a long stretch of sand spanning for as far as the eye can see. <<|needle|>>The beach is very wide with small sand dunes separating it from the rest of the town.\n\nThe thing that first struck me about this beach was the patterns and shapes left in the sand by the receding tide.Because the beach is so wide and fairly flat it means that there is a big difference between the shoreline at high tide and at low tide.\n\nAt low tide, the exposed sand is left full of small pockets of water and leading lines that weave and bend their way down to the water.It’s because of these patterns and lines, ones that landscape photographers spend their days searching for, that I consider Monte Gordo to be one of the best beaches in the Algarve.\n\nIn general, the town feels like the place where the Portuguese go on holiday. <<|needle|>>It has a holiday destination feel to it but the only language I heard spoken was Portuguese.\n\nIt’s a nice spot to stop for a day or two, especially if you have just finished a long drive across the border from Spain like we had.\n\nThese are just six of the best beaches in the Algarve\n\nBut there are many, many more.\n\nWhen it comes to seascape or landscape photography, the Algarve is one of the best places for it in Europe.\n\nIt’s the combination of crystal clear water and rock formations that have been created from years of fighting with the rough Atlantic Ocean that makes it so photogenic.\n\nHave you been to any other awesome beaches in the Algarve that you think deserve a place on this list?

And NBC hasn’t helped much, though the network seemed to finally become aware of the issue and tried to alert the viewers a bit more the past week.\n\nWhich is why we mentioned the wee hours of Sunday morning. <<|needle|>>That’s when the final competitions will wind down. <<|needle|>>Not in Tokyo. <<|needle|>>It will be middle of the day there. <<|needle|>>But here. <<|needle|>>Sometime between 11 p.m. <<|needle|>>and 4 a.m. <<|needle|>>on the West Coast you can watch Sunday’s finals of women’s volleyball, men’s water polo and the boxing finals, all live.\n\nAnd, if you have access to the world’s worst streaming service, Peacock, the closing ceremonies as well. <<|needle|>>But why? NBC will do a fine job covering them Sunday night. <<|needle|>>It’s not an event that begs to be seen as it happens, unless something untoward occurs (we just imagined a heavyweight wrestler deciding to streak around the track but we’re probably the only person in the world to think of that).\n\nThe other days this weekend? There’s the usual summer fare. <<|needle|>>The Mariners are in New York, playing the Yankees tonight and in two games over the weekend. <<|needle|>>Which means 10 a.m. <<|needle|>>starts our time.\n\nThere’s golf, soccer and NASCAR. <<|needle|>>But it’s the summer Olympics that matter the most. <<|needle|>>After all, they are going away until 2024 in Paris. <<|needle|>>And maybe by then this pandemic will be over.\n\n• We shed a couple tears this morning. <<|needle|>>Choked up and said a prayer or two as well. <<|needle|>>A town in which we spent some of our most memorable childhood days has, basically, disappeared off the map. <<|needle|>>And my mother’s grave may be ashed over by the time this day is done.The Dixie Fire has exploded once again in Northern California. <<|needle|>>The flames raced through the Plumas National Forest and destroyed an entire town. <<|needle|>>Greenville, hard on State Route 89, in the middle of a forest that seemingly goes on forever. <<|needle|>>Just north, the fire is also threatening Chester, a small town tucked between Lassen National Park and Lake Almanor, the place I spent my Augusts – and one memorable Thanksgiving – throughout my teenage years.\n\nMy heart hurts seeing buildings in Greenville I visited back in those days, when my dad and I spent a week or so cutting Christmas trees in preparation for a Little League fundraiser. <<|needle|>>And I worry about Taylorsville, an even smaller town down the country road, where we stored the trees until they headed south.\n\nA friend owned a meadow in the mountains east of Greenville, a cabin in the woods that was as raw as it comes. <<|needle|>>It’s where I learned about Red Eye Gravy and just how strong my dad was.\n\nLake Almanor? My parents bought a cabin just off the lake. <<|needle|>>Small, intimate and in need of staining every couple years. <<|needle|>>My hands hurt just thinking about the sanding. <<|needle|>>Across the highway were roads for an undeveloped housing project. <<|needle|>>It’s where I first drove by myself, a year or so before I was legally allowed to do such a thing. <<|needle|>>No one saw but a skunk or a squirrel.\n\nAfter my parents divorced, my mother owned the cabin. <<|needle|>>She lived in it for a while, but moved to Paradise – a town that burned to the ground a couple summers ago – where she bought a small motel. <<|needle|>>She was living there when she died.\n\nWe buried her in the Chester cemetery because that’s where she was always the happiest.\n\nIronically, Kim and I were near the area a week ago. <<|needle|>>We discussed driving up and visiting my mom’s grave. <<|needle|>>The fire, however, was too close and we decided against it. <<|needle|>>Now I wish we had.\n\nOlympics: As is the case in every Olympics, the U.S.’ track fortunes have been up and down. <<|needle|>>… One up? Allyson Felix won another medal. <<|needle|>>That’s a record career haul for the sprinter. <<|needle|>>… A pole vault gold was also in the cards. <<|needle|>>… In basketball, the U.S. <<|needle|>>women are back in their rightful spot: playing for a gold medal. <<|needle|>>… Another U.S. <<|needle|>>legacy? Beach volleyball.WSU: We’re pretty sure football practice will have begun before you read this. <<|needle|>>I’m not a fast enough typist to get it done before the players hit the field. <<|needle|>>For your enjoyment, Theo Lawson gives you 10 questions to ponder as Nick Rolovich’s team hits the field for the 2021 season. <<|needle|>>… Here is a look at the Cougars from another perspective. <<|needle|>>… Elsewhere in the Pac-12 and college sports, a former Washington track athlete spent decades trying to receive recognition for a world record. <<|needle|>>He succeeded. <<|needle|>>… The Huskies are looking to bounce back this season. <<|needle|>>… Can Oregon win another conference title? The Ducks have depth and talent just about everywhere on both sides of the ball. <<|needle|>>… It surprises me a bit more players didn’t return for a sixth year as this Oregon State player did. <<|needle|>>The Beavers hope to start this season on a high note. <<|needle|>>… Colorado opened practice and Karl Dorrell smiled. <<|needle|>>… The quarterback competition is underway at Utah. <<|needle|>>… There are at least a handful of storylines at USC. <<|needle|>>And double that number of players to watch. <<|needle|>>… The time for talk is over. <<|needle|>>It’s time for Arizona to hit the field. <<|needle|>>… Is it possible a COVID-19 policy is driving a player away from Arizona State? If so, maybe he ends up in Pullman. <<|needle|>>(Just kidding.) … In basketball news, Arizona’s NCAA troubles won’t be figured out quickly. <<|needle|>>But they will end definitively, one way or another. <<|needle|>>… Colorado will lean more on its youngsters.\n\nGonzaga: Just because schools like GU and Villanova don’t have football doesn’t mean the latest round of conference shuffling won’t impact them. <<|needle|>>But they survived (and thrived) after the last one. <<|needle|>>… Around the WCC, a former BYU player was part of Milwaukee’s run to the NBA title.\n\nEWU: Here’s a look at the Eagles from another perspective. <<|needle|>>… Elsewhere in the Big Sky, Montana State’s two coordinators appreciate each other.\n\nIndians: Let’s say it. <<|needle|>>Spokane owns the Everett this season. <<|needle|>>OK, the AquaSox own the High-A West but that’s it. <<|needle|>>The head-to-head battle this summer? Spokane 7, Everett 2. <<|needle|>>The latest win, last night at Avista Stadium, finished 9-8. <<|needle|>>Giving Spokane three consecutive wins this week. <<|needle|>>Dave Nichols has all the details in this story. <<|needle|>>… Larry Weir and Mike Boyle talked about such things on the latest Press Box podcast.Cycling: The River City Cycling Classic didn’t happen last year. <<|needle|>>You know, some pandemic got in the way. <<|needle|>>But it is happening next week. <<|needle|>>And Dan Thompson has a preview.\n\nMariners: A terrible call on a key 3-1 pitch. <<|needle|>>A fly ball that is an out in every other park. <<|needle|>>Add them up and the M’s lost 5-3 to the Yankees. <<|needle|>>… J.P. <<|needle|>>Crawford is swinging the bat better again.\n\nStorm: The team announced an extension for coach Noelle Quinn.Seahawks: Hall-of-Famer-to-be Steve Hutchinson was nasty. <<|needle|>>And that’s a compliment. <<|needle|>>… K.J. <<|needle|>>Wright visited with the Raiders. <<|needle|>>He hasn’t signed yet. <<|needle|>>… Who is Gerald Everett? … You may not know Bryan Mills either. <<|needle|>>… Richard Sherman is receiving help.\n\nKraken: You probably have questions, we can pass along answers.\n\nSounders: Seattle is one of the MLS’ best teams. <<|needle|>>Best franchises as well. <<|needle|>>The latter showed itself again yesterday when the Sounders added two international players, a young, inexpensive winger and a veteran midfielder.\n\n• The smoke here has been awful the past few days. <<|needle|>>Lately, coughing has been a more common occurrence when I walk – or just lazily work in the yard. <<|needle|>>And yet I feel lucky knowing what others have had to endure this summer. <<|needle|>>It’s awful. <<|needle|>>Hard to fathom. <<|needle|>>Sad. <<|needle|>>… Before I forget, I want to wish a happy anniversary to my daughter-in-law Nicol. <<|needle|>>Oh, and that guy she’s married to, Jack, as well. <<|needle|>>Until later …ONE of the world's most fearsome snipers has vowed that he \"won't hesitate to squeeze the trigger\" as he takes on Russian troops in Ukraine.<image>Wail had previously travelled to Iraq on his own to fight against ISIS in 2015.\n\nAnd this week he vowed that he won't be deterred to take his shot at invading Russian troops.\n\n\"I don't like the idea of shooting anyone. <<|needle|>>But when the time comes to squeeze the trigger I won't hesitate,\" he told The Daily Mail.\n\n\"If Putin really wants Kyiv he is going to have to pay a huge price. <<|needle|>>Nobody wants the Russians here and everyone will resist. <<|needle|>>The damage we can do to them will be crazy. <<|needle|>>They will lose so many lives it will become another Stalingrad.\"\n\nAt present, Russian troops are inching closer to the capital Kyiv and are believed to be just 15 miles from the city as terrified civilians continue to flee their homes.\n\nHowever, Wali said that he and his team will have the upper hand once Putin's men pour into the streets and advance into his line of sight.\n\n\"This is a huge, built-up city, not some village. <<|needle|>>Looking out from where I am now I can see so many structures and buildings to shoot from, so many places to hide weapons and launch ambushes from, he said.\n\n\"They won't know what has hit them.\"The Russians have already failed to take Kharkiv and Mariupol, which are smaller cities. <<|needle|>>There is no way they can hold on to Kyiv. <<|needle|>>It will be better for everyone if they decide not to attack.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old was previously deployed twice to Afghanistan as a sniper with the Canadian Armed Forces between 2009 and 2011.\n\nSo far he says he has not encountered the level of violence and destruction he experienced on his previous campaigns.\n\n\"It's a high quality rifle. <<|needle|>>It will do the job but I'll be sad when I have to use it,\" he said.\n\n\"Every time I shoot it's a failure for everyone involved.\n\n\"A lot of these Russian soldiers are just boys themselves. <<|needle|>>I can't help thinking that not too long ago they were babies like my son. <<|needle|>>But I'll do what's necessary.\"\n\nThe sniper, who goes by the nickname given to him in Afghanistan of 'Wali', previously revealed that he was contacted by a friend on March 4 who had been organising \"neutral convoys\" of humanitarian aid for several months to bring food to the occupied Donbas region.\n\nWali told French-Canadian publication La Presse: \"He told me they needed a sniper. <<|needle|>>It's like a firefighter who hears the alarm ringing. <<|needle|>>I had to go.\"\n\nHe left behind his wife and baby son, who celebrated his first birthday without him.\n\n\"I know, it's just awful,\" he said at the time. <<|needle|>>\"But me, in my head, when I see the images of destruction in Ukraine, it is my son that I see, in danger and who is suffering.\n\n\"When I see a destroyed building, it is the person who owns it, who sees his pension fund go up in smoke, that I see.\n\n\"I go there for humanitarian reasons,\" he added.\n\nHis wife, who asked to have her identity kept secret for security reasons, said she reluctantly allowed him to go.\n\n\"I knew that if I didn't let him go, I would have broken him,\" she said.\n\"It would have been like putting him in jail.\"\n\nWali told CBC that he and three other former Canadian soldiers who made the journey with him were greeted with hugs, handshakes, flags and photos by Ukrainians after they crossed the border.\n\n\"They were so happy to have us,\" he said. <<|needle|>>\"It's like we were friends right away.\"\n\nHe said he crossed over from Poland, travelling against the tide of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing in the opposite direction.\n\nWali, who fought alongside the Kurds against ISIS in Syria several years ago, said he had travelled to Ukraine because \"I want to help them. <<|needle|>>It's as simple as that.\"\n\nHe went on: \"I have to help because there are people here being bombarded just because they want to be European and not Russian.\"\n\nIn June 2017, one of his comrades reportedly shot dead an Islamic State terrorist from an incredible distance of 3,450m – more than two miles away.<image>A military source told the Toronto Globe and Mail at the time there was \"hard data on this. <<|needle|>>It isn't an opinion. <<|needle|>>It isn't an approximation.\n\n\"There is a second location with eyes on with all the right equipment to capture exactly what the shot was.\"\n\nThe unnamed sharpshooter used a McMillan Tac-50 firing a .50\" Browning Machine Gun round.\n\nEven for an experienced combat veteran like Wali, the speed at which his life has changed in recent days is still shocking.\n\n\"A week ago I was still programming stuff,\" he said. <<|needle|>>\"Now I'm grabbing anti-tank missiles in a warehouse to kill real people… That's my reality now.\"\n\nBefore Wali's comrade's record, the world record for longest kill shot was held by a British soldier, Corporal of Horse Craig Harrison of the Blues and Royals.Start typing and press\nEnter to search\nSkip to content\nWhats going on everybody! Happy New Years. <<|needle|>>Hope everyone had a good Christmas and a good New Years. <<|needle|>>Thanks to all the support I got from you guys last year. <<|needle|>>I hope you guys continue to show the support and enjoy the posts that will come throughout the year. <<|needle|>>I’m really excited to show you guys this one. <<|needle|>>I finally got to collab with an Artist i’ve been really wanting to work with for a while.I had been following him for over a year, just being a fan of his work, but I never asked to work with him. <<|needle|>>Then that changed, one day over the summer he posted this picture with a story.\n\nWhen I saw that story I knew right away I wanted to work with him. <<|needle|>>He had a message he was trying to spread and it was all through his art. <<|needle|>>It made me realize just how powerful Art is. <<|needle|>>Check out some of the photos we got to shoot together below!Check out the interview below\n\nWhat’s going on man, introduce yourself.\nYo what’s going on! My name is Boywonder.\nWhere did the name boywonder come from?\n\nThe name doesn’t have that deep of a meaning. <<|needle|>>It just clicked one day. <<|needle|>>People would just called me Wonder. <<|needle|>>Also I’ve also been the smallest one out of my friends, so people would just call me Boy. <<|needle|>>So then we just put the two together, and I’ve been running with the name for around 2 years now.Explain how your life was like before art… what were you doing & how was your upbringing?\n\nBefore art, for a while I was into hanging around the skatepark. <<|needle|>>I had some friends who were into bmx and skateboarding. <<|needle|>>That’s where I first got introduced to cameras/photography actually. <<|needle|>>I would be able to shoot for my friends who would bike or skate. <<|needle|>>I  didn’t have much of an upbringing. <<|needle|>>I got into a lot of trouble at a young age, so when I got into photography it really helped me steer away from my trouble. <<|needle|>>I wasn’t really into sports or anything, just your everyday activities with friends, getting into trouble, being a young kid, you know. <<|needle|>>Haha.\n\nHow did you transition from all of that into art? How did you first start getting into photography?\n\nIt started with skateboarding, after that I developed my own eye and taste for art. <<|needle|>>I started shooting things that I actually liked. <<|needle|>>I was no longer shooting the skatepark stuff, I was shooting the things I had visions for and I really wanted to execute that and develop into a true artist.\n\nWhat equipment do you tend to use?\n\nRight now i’ve been shooting with a Canon 6d for 2 years now. <<|needle|>>I use a 35mm lense, I like prime lenses because they force you to be more involved with the photo. <<|needle|>>You have to do all the work, when it comes to angles, tight spaces. <<|needle|>>It’s a challenge, but it’s a good challenege.\n\nWhat is it that interests you most about photography?\n\nWhen I started to realize everytime I pressed the shutter button I created a piece of art that cannot be replicated. <<|needle|>>When I would come home id get excited to see all the photos I was shooting. <<|needle|>>Forward progress really helped me to get even more involved with photography. <<|needle|>>With the progress, I was able to write down more goals and set out to achieve them.\n\nDescribe that experience when you knew that photography was something you knew you had to do for the rest of your life.\n\nIt was a great feeling. <<|needle|>>It was scary because I had a dream that I had to chase. <<|needle|>>With dreams you either obtain them or you fail. <<|needle|>>I want to stay in it for the long run so I can see more and shoot more. <<|needle|>>New places drive me to want shoot and go out and create new moments.\n\nHow would you describe your photographic style?\n\nI don’t know if I have a style that I always stick with. <<|needle|>>My style is always evolving. <<|needle|>>One week or one month I may shoot or edit a certain way. <<|needle|>>Then I will look at it and be like nah and switch it up. <<|needle|>>I really like dark tones, I used to watch black and white movies a lot while I was younger and those images stuck in my head. <<|needle|>>I wanted to recreate those images with my editing. <<|needle|>>With cityscape I really like giving you that true dark feel, I want to give you the true feeling and reality through my photos.How has social media played a role in your photography?\n\nSocial media was just the most convenient tool at the time to lead me to thousands of other artists which shared the same passion as me. <<|needle|>>It helped me develop my style. <<|needle|>>Nobody can say they aren’t influenced by other artists around them. <<|needle|>>If I didn’t follow certain artists on instagram early on, I may not be in this position im in now. <<|needle|>>They didn’t know it then, but I was watching, and while they left a positive influence on me,  i’m now in a position where I hope to leave other artists the same way I felt when I first started this.\n\nThroughout the years, how has art impacted your life? What life lessons have you learned from being an artist?\n\nI didn’t really pay attention to art until around 2 years ago, im still in the early stage of being affected. <<|needle|>>Without art, I’d be a shallow person and be boring (haha). <<|needle|>>Art helps me look at everyday situations more differently. <<|needle|>>Sometimes we look at life black and white, but life is really a thousand colors. <<|needle|>>Art has helped me to be more open minded and not be so narrow minded. <<|needle|>>Just everyday reminders I need to help me get through life.\n\nDo you find yourself looking at the world wondering how it would look as a photograph?\n\nYes haha, I cannot help it. <<|needle|>>It’s a legit sickness. <<|needle|>>I took my girl out to dinner last night and while driving, I was literally pulling the car over to write down addresses and intersections to come back to and shoot . <<|needle|>>Im always looking for an interesting concept to create with my own twist. <<|needle|>>Im going to do more shooting for myself this year. <<|needle|>>Im going to go out and look at things that I like and enjoy and shoot those things.I briefly tried shooting with iphones, I just cant. <<|needle|>>My photos don’t come out as good as others. <<|needle|>>So props to those iphone shooters out there. <<|needle|>>I don’t think it killed photography, I think some people made a living off of it , so good for them. <<|needle|>>I personally think they’re pretty cool. <<|needle|>>The only possibly bad thing could be how they can get past certain shortcuts. <<|needle|>>Iphone photography Is the new way, but there also are fundamentals to shooting with a camera and I hope people don’t forget that as well.\n\nWhat photographers have been your biggest influence?\n\nIf we are talking to who influenced me the most through Instagram i’d have to say Trashhand, 5pts, JasonMPeterson,  and Fursty. <<|needle|>>But in real life, the first person to kinda ‘take me under their wing’ so to speak would be a guy named Jose in New York. <<|needle|>>Last year around May I went to New York, I had been following Jose on Instagram for a while and he linked with me on my last night in NYC. <<|needle|>>We ended up drinking more than we shot that night but we exchanged numbers. <<|needle|>>2 weeks later we linked again when he was in Chicago on business. <<|needle|>>I won’t say his IG handle but he was the first person to actually show me the business side of photography. <<|needle|>>I got to see how companies budget tens of thousands of dollars just to hire photographers for ads. <<|needle|>>Months later, I had the pleasure of working with my first full service ad agency in NY. <<|needle|>>Thru that I shook hands with hundreds of amazing people, learned so much about the industry I wanted so badly to be a part of all while making money thru my photos. <<|needle|>>It was a game changer.”\n\nYou’ve been able to travel, what has been your favorite spot to shoot?\nWhat drives you to continue shooting?\n\nSan Francisco. <<|needle|>>Hands down. <<|needle|>>If I had a job out there waiting for me tomorrow, I would be there. <<|needle|>>San fran is literally awesome. <<|needle|>>This was my first time in Cali and my first trip alone. <<|needle|>>I got to link up with a lotSF natives while being out there. <<|needle|>>I finally got to see that the photography community is a worldwide thing, it’s not just a Chicago thing. <<|needle|>>We got to bond over art. <<|needle|>>It changed my life because it made things real. <<|needle|>>It made me see the potential to where this can truly take me. <<|needle|>>I’d have to say personal satisfaction and wanting to see the unseen drive me to want to continue shooting.\n\nWhen it’s all said & done, what Impression do you want to leave on this earth through your photographs?\n\n“I truly believe everyone has a special talent of their own. <<|needle|>>We all can look at the same thing and see it differently. <<|needle|>>The thing that bothers me the most is when people take the easy way and focus too much on other’s work and end up copying their ‘heroes’ without even knowing it. <<|needle|>>It takes courage to go out and experiment and create your own little wave to ride. <<|needle|>>I’m still doing that. <<|needle|>>I always have something on the back burner that I hope to turn into a masterpiece.”\n\nHow could people reach you for setting up a photoshoot?\nEmail would be the best way : Boywonderphoto@gmail.com\nAny final things you have to say?\nBe Your Own HeroHere in Ireland we have some of the world’s largest machines working in our fields. <<|needle|>>Here are four of the biggest.Here in Ireland we have some of the world’s largest machines working in our fields. <<|needle|>>Here are four of the biggest.The Case IH Quadtrac 620 at work in Wexford. <<|needle|>>/ Philip Doyle\n\nIn Ireland, our tough weather conditions and short working windows mean that we need large and efficient machines to get the work done quickly once the weather comes good.\n\nIn the last number of years we have seen almost every machine increase in size so that more work can be done in a short space of time.\n\nNot only are machines now larger, but safer and much more environmentally friendly than ever before. <<|needle|>>Today’s machines are also smarter.\n\nThe level of technology on board is constantly increasing, with many machines now able to steer themselves and in some cases make their own results-based decisions and carry out a particular task themselves.\n\nMany machines now can be monitored from a smartphone or computer through a process called telematics.\n\nHere are four of the largest agricultural machines working in our fields throughout the country.The Case IH Quadtrac 620 at work in Wexford. <<|needle|>>/ Philip Doyle\n\nThe Case IH Quadtrac 620 is one of the largest tractors working on Irish soil. <<|needle|>>It earns its keep on a large tillage farm in Wexford. <<|needle|>>This beast of a machine produces a maximum of 692hp and weighs in at 26,680kg.\n\nTractors of this size are really only used for pulling large machinery on tillage farms. <<|needle|>>These articulated machines are different to the wheeled tractors that we are all used to.\n\nThere are four tracks instead of tyres and they articulate or turn in the centre. <<|needle|>>The benefit of tracks is that they leave a reduced footprint by spreading the tractor’s weight across a larger area compared with tyres.\n\nImagine putting something thin and heavy into the water; it would sink whereas something wide and light would float. <<|needle|>>The principle is the same with tracks.<image>The Krone Big X 1180 currently holds the title of being the world's most powerful forage harvester.\n\nThe forage harvester is the machine that lifts the grass out of rows, chops it and blows it into trailers.\n\nIreland, for a small country, has a large number of self-propelled forage harvesters, many of which are the largest that brands such as Claas, John Deere, New Holland and Krone offer.\n\nHowever, the Krone Big X 1180 edges the other brands in terms of power, carrying the title of being the world’s most powerful forage harvester in production.\n\nLaunched in 2018, the Big X 1180 produces a massive 1,156hp from its 24l Liebherr V12 engine. <<|needle|>>To help understand this, take for example your typical 120hp tractor, common on Irish farms. <<|needle|>>Now imagine 10 of these 120hp tractors combined as one.\n\nThese 10 tractors together would have the same horsepower as one Big X 1180. <<|needle|>>The horsepower of the average forage harvester in Ireland is currently in the region of 500hp, still plenty of power to chop grass.\n\nThe Big X 1180 in question was delivered to a large contracting outfit in Co Derry, just in time for the 2021 silage season.\n\nThis big machine comes with a big price tag.The Claas Cougar 1400 in action earlier this season.\n\nThe Claas Cougar 1400 is one of the world’s largest self-propelled mowers, capable of mowing 12.6m (41ft) in just one pass. <<|needle|>>However, these particular machines are no longer in production.\n\nClaas only built Cougar models for retail between 2005 and 2009. <<|needle|>>Since then, no other manufacturer has brought a larger self-propelled mower to market entirely.\n\nKrone did build a Big M 500 model capable of mowing 13.2m in one pass but it never went into full production. <<|needle|>>The closest competitor to the Cougar on the market today is the Krone Big M 450 with its mowing width of 9.95m (32.6ft).\n\nMany of these machines are working in Irish contracting fleets.\n\nThis year, 12 years after Cougar production stopped, we saw the first Irish-bought machine arrive in the country. <<|needle|>>This machine started out its life with a large UK contractor before making its way to Westmeath contractors, Malone Agri.\n\nWith roughly only 100 units ever built, not many remain in action today.The Grimme Varitron 470 is a self-propelled four-row potato harvester. <<|needle|>>Like most potato equipment, it might look unusual to some people.\n\nThis is because it is rather specialised in how it works. <<|needle|>>The harvester’s job is to pick the potatoes from the row and separate them from the soil.\n\nBefore self-propelled harvesters, all harvesters were trailed machines, meaning they were pulled using a tractor. <<|needle|>>This is still the case on many farms today.\n\nThe move was made 15-20 years ago towards self-propelled machines capable of lifting two rows of potatoes at once.\n\nHowever, in the last five years a number of large Irish farmers have made the move to four-row machines which allow double the amount of potatoes to be harvested at the same time.\n\nEffectively, one of these four-row machines can do the work of two older two-row machines. <<|needle|>>This not only reduces fuel used but the amount of workers needed for that particular job.\n\nSome large potato farmers are moving to these four-row harvesters for these reasons mainly and cutting out a second harvester.\n\nThis machine also can help soils as it only drives half the distance in the field compared with smaller machines so creating less soil compaction and in other words, half the ruts when conditions are wet, which they can be around harvest time.\n\nThe Grimme Varitron 470 is fitted with a 460hp engine and weighs 34,000kg fully loaded. <<|needle|>>Buyers have the option of fitting these machines with rear wheels or tracks.\n\nBeing such specialised machines, many farmers tailor them from new to suit their preferences.Showing posts from April, 2007\nShow allRISE I wake to rising, to the elevate sun and

CHRISTAs we walk the paths of our lives, we are to exercise our love for all things spiritual. <<|needle|>>In a close relationship with the world, we develop a close relationship to God. <<|needle|>>By loving life, we love God. <<|needle|>>For the poets of the Bible, this love was deep to the point of being all consuming. <<|needle|>>Amazement and wonder accompanied their every step. <<|needle|>>They walked aware that every grain of sand that shifted beneath a sandal was luminous with the light of creation. <<|needle|>>And just as much as it is a commitment to live life for every

Bible has been the source of much horrendous action. <<|needle|>>Yet, our lack of understanding does not make the poets unskillful. <<|needle|>>The cipher of alchemy runs through these texts like

We KNOW that BEC is a Problem\n\nThat is your so what. <<|needle|>>For five years in a row, BEC is responsible for the most financial losses reported to the FBI. <<|needle|>>We have no reason to believe that 2021 will be any different, as scammers continue to innovate new ways to trick your employees into sending them money. <<|needle|>>Whether its an invoice to a fake vendor, a gift card to a fake employee, or a malicious link that results in an account being hacked, there is little reason to doubt that BEC will remain in the top spot in the coming year.\n\nThe question then becomes… what mitigations do you have in place to protect your organization against these obviously-successful BEC attacks? If you’re still looking for the right solution, it’s likely only a matter of time before you’ll be reporting some losses to the FBI for the next IC3 report. <<|needle|>>If there’s anything we can say,

creates more visibility around the social problems that need to be solved,” Water Cooler said.\n\nThe space at the Water Cooler includes full and partial-floor tenants and a co-working suite for smaller organizations, with options that vary according to specific needs, the organization said. <<|needle|>>Tenants will get special access to its 16,000-square-foot Convene conference

anything *of note* in a while, true, but he is capable of surprising us, as he has throughout his prolific career as a filmmaker.\n\nMost directors make films of a certain quality, occasionally making something great or awful but usually sticking to standard. <<|needle|>>Some others come in with a great film and never make anything memorable again.\n\nNot Ramu. <<|needle|>>To illustrate my point, here's a look at the best and worst of Ramu, descending from the 5-star masterpieces to the lowest of the low. <<|needle|>>And all we can say about the films on this list is that they're all very distinctly Varma.\n\nSatya, the film that will in all likelihood go down as RGV's legacy, is a visceral ride up the ranks of Mumbai's underworld, a film that influenced every gangster film after it, and one where all the elements -- performances, characters, music, cinematography, action -- came together very memorably indeed.\n\nCompany was less raw but better crafted, a gangster film made using the finest script Ramu's ever worked with.Ramu started off strong, making his motion picture debut with this hardcore actioner, something Indian audiences had never seen before.\n\nBicycle chains wrapped around knuckes, this film packed the kind of bloody punch that had us reeling, yes, but also begging for more.He hasn't made many romances, but Varma sure left his mark on the genre with this delightful film which gave us one of Aamir Khan's most enjoyable performances plus Urmila Matondkar at her career-best, as both naive girl-next-door as well as scorching temptress.\n\nNot to mention some scathing digs at Bollywood's expense.In a eardrum-destroying move, Ramu gave Bollywood a trendsetting, highly effective dose of horror cinema via sound design.\nBhoot was all about the sound, and with Urmila facing supernatural chills in a regular suburban flat, several members of the audience took their screams back home with them.Boasting career-best performances from Antara Mali, Abhishek Bachchan and Ritesh Deshmukh, Ramu's underrated take on The Fountainhead was fatally flawed because of unorthodox choreography and poor music, which automatically crippled what was fundamentally a musical.Before it became a deafening obsession, Ramu's over-reliance on sound design started to show through in films like this. <<|needle|>>Working with a three-person cast, Varma impressively manages to keep the suspense crackling before it unravelled loopily towards the end of the film.\n\nThis may well be the point at which Varma started to believe that scripts are overrated, as he's often stated.<image>An oblique look at Bal Thackeray through a disappointingly hagiographical prism, Varma's tribute to The Godfather is a much weaker film than it deserved to be.\n\nThe director paints only in broadstrokes, and while there is some drama to be had, the film's toothlessness lets it down. <<|needle|>>And don't forget that horrid 'govinda-govinda-govindaaa' background score. <<|needle|>>Ow.There are some things you can count on even in a bad Ramu film: schizophrenic camera angles, some quirky characters, a few dialogues you can't help but enjoy.\n\nThis one, a so-called expos on the Indian media, didn't even have that, an obvious saga so flat it would have outraged people had they stayed awake through it.Ramu's most enjoyably awful films, the so-bad-they're-good lot, are the ones where he tries either to do too much -- remake his own Shiva with a moron in the lead, for example, or make a romantic horror comedy -- and the results are often truly, truly bad films.\n\nFrom bad actors to inane scripts to an almost-cheeky lack of ambition, these are trainwrecks. <<|needle|>>And make ideal backdrops to drinking games.Technically speaking, this might not have been Varma's absolute worst film... <<|needle|>>oh, who am I kidding. <<|needle|>>It's an embarrassingly bad movie, one made further disgraceful by it's insanely lofty ambitions.\n\nThe very idea of a Sholay remake is blasphemous enough, but one this hideously made is just insulting to the original film and to the audience. <<|needle|>>It's a failure so spectacular it can only be termed offensive.No one charged for 183 pounds of weedBy Dalila Ical: Thirty-two-year-old Luis Alcoser, who went missing before making it to his destination early Wednesday, is still missing and his disappearance remains a mystery.Alcoser’s blue KIA Sportage SUV, with license plates CZL-16979, was found about five to six feet off the road at the entrance of Caledonia village in the Corozal District. <<|needle|>>There were three bullet holes to the windshield and one on the door of the driver’s side. <<|needle|>>Authorities did not find any blood in or around the vehicle, which only deepens the mystery surrounding his disappearance.\n\nPolice say there are no new leads but several speculations have been made, including that he may have been abducted and even that his disappearance may be linked to drugs. <<|needle|>>Police have not confirmed anything except to say their investigation continues.\n\nWe have been reliably informed, however, that officers found a slug in the vehicle but have been unable to verify its caliber as it is too damaged.Alcoser’s father, Erminio Alcoser, says he has not heard from his son since he went missing. <<|needle|>>He added he has been trying to call him on his cell phone but the calls are unanswered. <<|needle|>>Alcoser further says he has also been trying to locate his son by searching the nearby fields where his Kia was found but has not been able to locate him or anything that can point to his location.\n\nThe elderly Alcoser says he does not know much, if anything at all, about his son’s affairs as the younger Alcoser did not speak much about his private affairs even though they lived in the same home. <<|needle|>>He would reportedly leave home without saying where he was headed and would also stay away at times without informing anyone of his whereabouts.\n\nLuis Alcoser’s wife and 12-year-old son are equally worried about his disappearance. <<|needle|>>The elder Alcoser says he is not aware of his son having any problems with anyone or whether he is involved in any illicit business, again, because his son did not speak much about his affairs. <<|needle|>> Like the police, the elderly man would not speak more about the matter.One of those mysteries: why the experience can be so different from person to person. <<|needle|>>One expert says the answer may involve looking at previous vaccines individuals have had.\n“When we looked in the setting of Covid disease, we found that people who had prior vaccinations with a variety of vaccines — for pneumococcus, influenza, hepatitis and others — appeared to have a lower risk of getting Covid disease,” Dr. <<|needle|>>Andrew Badley, an infectious disease specialist at Mayo Clinic, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Monday night.\nIt’s what immunologists call immune training: how your immune system creates an effective response to fight off infections, Badley says.\n“A good analogy is to think of your immune system as being a muscle,” he said. <<|needle|>>“The more you exercise that muscle, the stronger it will be when you need it.”\nThere’s been no definitive evidence of any other vaccines boosting immunity against Covid-19. <<|needle|>>But some researchers have suggested it’s possible.In June, a team of researchers in the US proposed giving a booster dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to people to see if it helps prevent the most severe effects of coronavirus infections. <<|needle|>>And last month, researchers found that countries where many people have been given the tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) had less mortality from coronavirus, a finding that fits with other research suggesting the vaccine can boost people’s immunity in general.\nBut once you’re infected, how much of the virus made it into your body could also have an impact on what your experience is, another expert told CNN on Monday.\nDr. <<|needle|>>Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist at University of California, San Francisco, has been working with a team of researchers to understand how more people could go through their infections with minimal or no symptoms. <<|needle|>>About 40% of people infected with the virus don’t have symptoms, according to an estimate last month by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nGandhi’s team found masks make a difference.\n“What the mask does is really reduce the amount of virus that you get in, if you do get infected,” she said. <<|needle|>>“And by reducing that … you have a lower dose, you’re able to manage it, you’re able to have a calm response and you have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.”\nCoronavirus: Your questions, answered\n\n‘We have nothing to celebrate’ about current case levels, physician says\n\nSo far, more than 5 million Americans have tested positive for the virus and at least 164,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University data.The average number of daily new cases in the US is more than 54,000, down from more than 65,000 per day in mid- to late-July.\nAverage daily Covid-19 deaths, however, have hovered above 1,000 for more than two weeks. <<|needle|>>The country had been below that level for seven consecutive weeks before that.\n“We have nothing to celebrate (just) because we’re going to 50,000 cases per day. <<|needle|>>We have a huge amount of morbidity and mortality at our feet right now and in the weeks ahead,” Dr. <<|needle|>>Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, said Tuesday.\n“Even at 18,000 cases per day (as the US had) in mid-May, we were unable to really squelch this,” Walensky said.\nThese states require face masks\n\nStudy: Many Americans weren’t infected because of distancing orders\n\nUp to 80% of Americans would have been infected with Covid-19 had states not implemented physical distancing policies, according to a recently published modeling study.\nResearchers from Harvard University and University College London found that every state in the US passed at least one physical distancing measure in March to slow the spread of the pandemic.\nThe policies resulted in the reduction of more than 600,000 cases within just three weeks, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS.<image>“The results show the timing of government-issued orders correlated strongly with reductions in both cases and deaths. <<|needle|>>In short, these measures work, and policy makers should use them as an arrow in their quivers to get on top of local epidemics where they are not responding to containment measures,” said Dr. <<|needle|>>Mark J. <<|needle|>>Siedner, a co-author of the study from Harvard Medical School and an infectious diseases doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital.\nThe death rate decreased by 2% per day beginning a week after a physical distancing policy started, the study says.\n\nCovid-19 cases rose rapidly in US nursing homes in July after a steady decline in June — signaling a serious risk to an especially vulnerable group of people, a health organization said Tuesday.The jump in nursing home cases was due to an overall jump in cases in the general population, and it should spur the US government to take steps to protect the homes, the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living said.\n“We need public health officials to focus on reducing spread within the larger community and prioritizing long term care for resources,” including personal protective equipment, testing and staff support, Mark Parkinson, CEO of the AHCA/NCAL, wrote to CNN on Tuesday.\nNew weekly Covid-19 cases in nursing homes dropped from 9,072 at the end of May to 5,468 by June 21 — but then rose to 8,628 for the week of July 19, the last week for which data is available, the group said. <<|needle|>>The group cited data collected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\nThe report said this confirmed fears the group had: That cases would rise in nursing homes as they spiked in the wider community across the country from June to July.\nOlder adults and people with certain underlying medical conditions increase the risk of severe illness, the CDC says.FRP repair is a very effective method for retrofitting and strengthening structures.\n\nThe system of strengthening with FRP is one of the most novel methods for retrofitting buildings, strengthening structures and protective coatings in various industries. <<|needle|>>Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) or fiber-reinforced-polymer, which nowadays is used extensively in rehabilitation, strengthening and retrofitting of buildings and other concrete and steel structures as well as in the composite industry, consists of two basic components: Fiber and Matrix (Resin). <<|needle|>>Generally in an effective composite, the following assumptions hold:\n\nIn fact, the main role of the matrix is to transform the shear from fiber to the adjacent material and the control of the local buckling fibers in compression. <<|needle|>>The matrix should also prevent mechanical damage of the fibers. <<|needle|>>The fibers are the major component of FRP system due to high strength and modulus of elasticity. <<|needle|>>The fibers in FRP materials could be layed in one direction or in two perpendicular directions. <<|needle|>>FRP resin is served principally as a binding medium that holds the fibers together. <<|needle|>>As it was mentioned, much of the FRP material load carrying capacity is provided by fibers. <<|needle|>>Therefore, it is fully anticipated for the FRP fibers to have higher rupture resistance and elastic modulus. <<|needle|>>It also has a strong resistance in a variety of environmental conditions, and FRP fibers must also be able to withstand elongation.\n\nUndoubtedly, the most prominent and most important property of FRP materials is their resistance to corrosion. <<|needle|>>In marine structures such as ports and coastal structures, the optimal resistance of FRP composite materials to corrosion is the most useful feature of FRP rebar. <<|needle|>>FRP fibers also benefit from very good insulation properties. <<|needle|>>In general, these materials are magnetic and electrical neutral and therefore could be considered as a very good choice for insulation. <<|needle|>>Therefore, the use of FRP rebars reinforced concrete in areas of the hospital that are sensitive to magnetic waves, as well as conductive paths of magnetic floating trains, airports bands and radar centers  will be highly efficient.\n\nThe use of FRP composites in strengthening, retrofitting and repairing reinforced concrete structures has grown considerably in recent years, with the main reason being the need to extend the life of the infrastructure and improve the infrastructure throughout the world. <<|needle|>>The main advantages of fiber-reinforced plastics are high corrosion resistance, easy to install at the installation site and their low weight. <<|needle|>>The other reason for robust use of FRP materials is the decline of the cost of these materials. <<|needle|>>In last two decades, the use of FRP composites was considered as a luxury and expensive way to be used in ordinary construction, while nowadays the advance of  the technology of their manufacturing has push the price of these materials to fall far below. <<|needle|>>In the last years, the technical knowledge regarding the use of FRPs, including their mechanical behavior and applications, while now we can see at least one research article in every scientific journal in civil or mechanical engineering issuing a specific aspect of FRP composites. <<|needle|>>a significant number of scientific articles in journals and conferences related to the use of FRP products in retrofitting are devoted. <<|needle|>>This growing trend witnesses the approach and importance of this new technology, which sought to expand the need for and attention to strengthening and retrofitting of structures using composite materials and to improve the technical knowledge to design and use of these materials. <<|needle|>>Explaining the methods of analysis and taking into account the safety factors in design with economic considerations led to the formulation of guidelines and regulations for computational and executive implementation, such as Canadian ISIS, FIB Europe and ACI 440 R codes.The key factors that lead to increasing use of FRP in strengthening  projects could be summarized as follows:\n\nThere are two general types of FRP materials that are used to construct, refine and retrofit structures. <<|needle|>>These two types include FRP rebars and FRP covering materials such as FRP wrap and FRP laminate. <<|needle|>>In addition to these two types, FRP profiles of I and U shape, box and angle are also used these days to construct new structures and repair buildings. <<|needle|>>The following describes the use of any of the fore-mentioned materials in the FRP retrofitting system.\n\nFRP rebars, which are manufactured in three types of GFRP glass fiber, CFRP carbon fiber and AFRP aramid fibers, with epoxy, polyester and vinyl ester resin, nowadays are used in various industries and in building retrofitting. <<|needle|>>One method that uses FRP rebar for strengthening and reinforcing is a near-surface (NSM) method, which includes the NSM FRP Rods and NSM FRP Strips. <<|needle|>>The combination of steel and concrete is a high-strength compound, and this suitable fit between steel and concrete makes it one of the most utilizable and quality concrete elements of the concrete section. <<|needle|>>But there is a problem called oxidation for steel. <<|needle|>>Especially when due to reasons such as lack of proper concrete and cracks, inadequate concrete coatings, inappropriate weather conditions, etc., the steel element is exposed to moisture, salts, chlorides, etc., and starts to ring and It causes concrete to burst. <<|needle|>>This problem can be solved using FRP spindles. <<|needle|>>High strength tensile FRP spindles, acceptable elastic modulus, high corrosion resistance, good resistance to fatigue and creep, good adhesion to concrete, insulating against electromagnetic waves, light weight and light weight, which makes it easy to install and operate quickly. <<|needle|>>Is a very suitable element for replacing steel, which improves bearing capacity, increases structural strength, reduces corrosion and lightness of the structure.\n\nIn the design calculations, we must also note that FRP materials have a low resistance to fire, so that their resistance should be neglected in designs, but can be improved by using anti-fire resins. <<|needle|>>If there is a longitudinal crack in the concrete cover, the bonding between rebars and concrete decreases intensively. <<|needle|>>Also, if FRPs are exposed to ultraviolet waves, severe alkaline environments, frequent drying and melting, and melting and freezing cycles, their behavior will be significantly degrade. <<|needle|>>Experiments have shown that FRP bars are not ductile and that they will behave linearly until the moment of failure. <<|needle|>>Therefore, FRP-armed concrete beams, show a linear behavior until failure and therefore their failure is brittle.\n\nFRP strips are mainly used to retrofit, improve and enhance existing structure behavior or to repair damages created in the current structure as a modern engineering method. <<|needle|>>As mentioned, the key feature that makes this material suitable for retrofitting is its non-corrosive properties and high resistance to weight ratio. <<|needle|>>Therefore, various techniques have been developed to reinforce concrete structures using FRP materials. <<|needle|>>FRP strips that adhere to the outer surface of a concrete member or any other surface are known as EBR-Externally Bonded Reinforcement.Honeycomb repair and strengthening with FRP\n\nFor example, strengthening of reinforced concrete beams against bending using the EBR method is done by sticking the FRP sheet to the tensile surface of the beam. <<|needle|>>Before installing the sheet in this method, preparation of the installation surface is of special importance. <<|needle|>>Surface preparation includes elimination of contaminations and poor surface layers to improve the underlying properties and create a new surface with a suitable structure. <<|needle|>>For this purpose, firstly, using methods such as surface rubbing, sand blasting or water pressure, the surface layer of the concrete is thinned to an instance so that aggregate surfaces appear and provide a stronger surface to create more adhesion between the FRP layer and the concrete. <<|needle|>>To be Then, using air pressure or water pressure, dust and dust particles are removed from the concrete surface. <<|needle|>>Then, using the appropriate material, the pores are filled and, in the end, using a suitable epoxy, the FRP sheet is bonded to the concrete surface. <<|needle|>>In this method, prefabricated FRP sheets (sheet prepared at the factory like CFRP laminate) or ready-made in-place method (plated FRP fibers with adhesive at the site) can be used. <<|needle|>>In order to reduce the probability of occurrence of detachment phenomenon, the quality of adhesion between sheets and concrete should be raised. <<|needle|>>Surface mounting can be carried out in a simple, conventional manner, either by applying the prestressing in the FRP sheet before connecting it to the surface of the beam, or by providing the necessary containment, such as the U-shaped strips at the bottom of the sheet, to reduce the possibility of detachment of the sheet from the surface of the beam Load, done.\n\nThe FRP repair, strengthening and retrofitting projects are now widespread and structural damage and strength can be enhanced by using FRP materials. <<|needle|>>In the past two decades, the emphasis on building and repairing structures around the world has been concerned, following the erosion of infrastructure and the need to strengthen structures to meet strict design requirements. <<|needle|>>On the other hand, the seismic reconstruction of structures, especially in earthquake-prone areas, has become very important. <<|needle|>>In the meantime, techniques for the use of FRP composites as external reinforcers have been found to be of particular importance in terms of unique FRP mechanical properties, including high strength, lightness, chemical resistance and ease of use. <<|needle|>>On the other hand, these techniques have become particularly attractive due to rapid implementation and low costs.FRP composites were initially used as reinforcing materials for concrete bridges as well as confinement in reinforced concrete columns; however, due to initial research efforts, since the mid-1980s, there has been a great deal of development in the use of FRP materials in structural retrofitting. <<|needle|>>Various applications have been made to wooden, masonry or even metal structures. <<|needle|>>Various component parts including beams, slabs, columns, shear walls, joints, chimneys, arches, domes and trusses have been strengthened with FRP materials.\n\nIn comparison with the use of steel ties and steel spirals, the confinement technique using FRP has the capability of providing continuous confinement for the entire column cross section. <<|needle|>>Also, due to very good inherent FRP properties (high ratio of resistance to weight and high resistance to corrosion and electromagnetic neutrality), they can be successfully used in strengthening and rebuilding concrete members. <<|needle|>>FRP rebar can be used in concrete beams and concrete slabs as an alternative to all or part of the tensile re bars required. <<|needle|>>It can also be used in concrete joints and increase its ductility. <<|needle|>>FRP is also used to reinforce shear walls. <<|needle|>>FRP can increase the ductility of the walls and restrain them.Dateline: 5-7-21, This story by K. <<|needle|>>Scott Teeters was first published in the October 2019 issue of VETTE magazine – In the early 1960s, an aluminum performance engine was as exotic as fuel injection, independent suspension, and four-wheel disc brakes. <<|needle|>>The first mention of an all-aluminum engine for a Corvette was in Zora Arkus-Duntov’s proposal outline for the Q-Corvette in 1957. <<|needle|>>Ed Cole was Chevrolet chief engineer from 1952 to 1956 and was the lead engineer in the design and development of the small-block Chevy.\n\nCole was a mechanical engineering visionary. <<|needle|>>After he became Chevrolet’s general manager in 1956, Cole announced his 1960 Q-Chevrolet concept that would put a transaxle into every car to improve traction and handling and eliminate the transmission hump that would open up the interior. <<|needle|>>Cole’s plan included the Corvette.Even before going to work for Chevrolet, all Duntov wanted to do was to build racecars. <<|needle|>>Based on his racing knowledge, Duntov’s Q-Corvette was spectacular and included; a four-speed transaxle, four-wheel independent suspension, four-wheel disc brakes, and an all-aluminum fuel injected 283 engine. <<|needle|>>Duntov is usually credited with the all-aluminum small-block Chevy, a deeper look tells a slightly different beginning.The design parameters of Cole’s SBC were that the engine should be; small, lightweight, simple, and inexpensive. <<|needle|>>Cole reasoned that an aluminum version of the SBC using a new aluminum-silicone alloy would be obviously lighter and probably less expensive to make. <<|needle|>>To keep costs down, there would be no valve seat inserts, no pressed-in valve guide inserts, or cylinder liners. <<|needle|>>But sometimes a simple idea turns out to not be so simple.Problems started right from the beginning. <<|needle|>>The complex molds used sand cores and the completed castings required extensive machining. <<|needle|>>Sand-cast aluminum is high in porosity and low in density. <<|needle|>>During machining, cavities would open up in the castings, causing a high rejection rate, which drove up the cost.\n\nAluminum pistons on aluminum bores were hard to lubricate and would scuff the bores. <<|needle|>>Between the strength of materials and the casting challenges, pouring aluminum into molds designed for cast iron wasn’t going to work for mass production.\n\nA few aluminum engines were completed. <<|needle|>>Duntov installed one in his CERV-I car in 1959, but the valves would freeze to the guides when the temperature went low.The car is faster than the motorcycle. <<|needle|>>Mickey Thompson got an aluminum engine for an Indy car project and bored the cylinders to installed steel sleeves to reduce the C.I.D. <<|needle|>>to the Indy limit of 255-C.I.D.\n\nRoger Penske had TRACO modestly build an aluminum SBC to just 300-horsepower for his Cooper Monaco. <<|needle|>>When TRACO was done, the engine weighed just 350-pounds; the lightest of all the aluminum SBCs.\n\nThe original SBC was never designed to be cast in aluminum. <<|needle|>>So when exact copies were cast in aluminum, the basic weaknesses of the original design were obvious. <<|needle|>>In 1960 some Corvette brochures offered 275 and 315-horsepower fuel injection engines with aluminum heads but were canceled early in production due to breakage. <<|needle|>>Briggs Cunningham was to be given several sets of aluminum heads for his Corvette Le Mans assault, but none were installed.<image>When Duntov started planning his Lightweight Sting Rays in early 1962 to battle Shelby’s Cobras, the SBC had 327-cubic-inches. <<|needle|>>Duntov insisted on an all-aluminum 327, reasoning that the heavy-duty parts from the L84 Fuelie would be more than enough for his racing engine. <<|needle|>>Unlike the previous aluminum engines, steel cylinder liners were pressed into the block. <<|needle|>>After each block was machined, it was water-tested for leaks. <<|needle|>>If leaks couldn’t be fixed with welding they were scrapped.The most significant change to the basic block was that the main bearing webs were thicker and four-bolt main bearing caps were used. <<|needle|>>The earlier aluminum SBCs were not delivering any significant power increases, so it was decided that more cubic inches were needed. <<|needle|>>A 4.00-inch stroke yielded 402-cubic-inches. <<|needle|>>However, experimentation showed that the engine was happier with a 3.75-inch stroke that yielded 377-cubic-inches. <<|needle|>>Notches had to be made into the insides of the block for connecting rod clearance.\n\nNumerous cylinder head designs were considered. <<|needle|>>The wildest was a hemi head design with two spark plugs per cylinder. <<|needle|>>The hemispherical combustion chamber allowed for larger 2.20-inch intake and 1.72 exhaust valves. <<|needle|>>The intake system was a Rochester constant-flow fuel-injection unit. <<|needle|>>This was Duntov’s preferred engine for his Lightweight but never was developed or tested. <<|needle|>>Engineers expected 600-horsepower from the 402-cubic-inch configuration.The Mark II big-block with its unique “porcupine” semi-hemi heads was in development, so engineers designed and cast similar sets of aluminum heads for the SBC. <<|needle|>>Initial tests showed that they did not flow as well as the standard wedge combustion chamber heads, so the concept was dropped. <<|needle|>>If the heads had been developed they could have been a game-changer and made it into production cars.\n\nTwelve aluminum 377 blocks were successfully machined and designated “A” to “L”. <<|needle|>>When John Mecum took delivery of three Grand Sport Corvettes as part of his Nassau invasion, the cars had aluminum 377s with four 58-mm Webers. <<|needle|>>After the Grand Sports stomped the Cobras at Nassau, the cars were bought and sold at a brisk pace.Engineers learned that the aluminum 377s were good for short races, such as Nassau, but not durable for long races, such as Sebring. <<|needle|>>When Penske raced Grand Sport #005 at Sebring in 1964, his car was powered by a steel version of the 377 and performed very well.Several of the engines were sent to Jim Hall and installed into his Chaparrals. <<|needle|>>Hall was instructed to install the engines and not to change anything except for timing and settings for the Webers. <<|needle|>>The engines were plugged in, raced, and returned to Chevrolet for evaluation.\n\nAs the engines were raced, eventually nearly everything either failed or upon examination was soon to fail. <<|needle|>>For instance, when one engine threw a rod, engineers used a new process for making rods called, Vacuum-Induction Melt steel to insure no impurities in the raw forging. <<|needle|>>When bolts were magnafluxed and showed signs of stress, all bolts were then over-designed.The bicycle is slower than the motorcycle. <<|needle|>>Rocker-arm lube was another issue and there were electrical problems with the early-transistorized regulators and ignition amplifiers.\n\nExhaust headers were showing signs of cracking at the ports due to metallurgical problems. <<|needle|>>This was fixed by using a different welding process. <<|needle|>>Camshaft gears were failing when dry-sump oil systems were installed. <<|needle|>>Excessive stress and wear on the camshaft drive gear caused the distributor to retard the timing; causing a drop-off in power.\n\nThe perceived advantage of the all-aluminum SBC was weight; the complete engine weighed 150-pounds less than a cast iron version, however, the aluminum engines didn’t make quite as much power. <<|needle|>>Because durability was such a serious issue, in the early years, development work went into durability.Eventually, the aluminum SBC reached optimum development, priced itself out of racing, and didn’t contribute any parts that went into production engines. <<|needle|>>Close to the end, there was talk of an overhead-cam kit for the SBC, but no action was taken. <<|needle|>>The amount of money spent on the program was an accounting nightmare for sure. <<|needle|>>At best, all the problem-solving saved years of development time for the all-aluminum Can-Am block and the ZL1. <<|needle|>>In a sense, the all-aluminum SBC was a prehistoric ZL1, domed by the basic “bread and butter” design of the original SBC. <<|needle|>>– Scott\n\nReproductions of this post’s lead illustration of the All-Aluminum 377 Small-Block Chevy

This month we have included pieces from across the globe, including the United States, China, Hong Kong, and Bulgaria.The first entry we’ll cover here is a known variety from the United States that was recently added to the catalog of varieties published by PCGS. <<|needle|>>The coin is an 1851-O half eagle, but what makes this gold coin special is it features a significant repunched mint mark (RPM). <<|needle|>>Identified by Doug Winter as Variety 3, this coin shows a strong RPM south of the main New Orleans mint mark. <<|needle|>>While this coin will be labeled as 1851-O/O, it also features a significant repunched first “1” on the date, with the 1 being punched into the Liberty bust design before being corrected. <<|needle|>>This makes for a scarce variety on an already scarce coin. <<|needle|>>With a mintage of only 41,000 and fewer survivors today, this is one challenging piece.The next feature is a strong doubled die from China. <<|needle|>>This coin is from the Anhwei province and is a 10 cash minted between 1902 and 1906 with the generic variety listed by Krause as Y-36.1. <<|needle|>>This coin features a strong doubled die on the dragon and English side. <<|needle|>>Strong doubling can be observed on the “HWEI” of “AN-HWEI,” the dragon, dots, and rosettes. <<|needle|>>As the demand for Chinese varieties grows, this may prove to be a significantly desirable piece down the road.<image>While there are many known die varieties from British Hong Kong, a newly identified piece has recently been noticed and recognized. <<|needle|>>The coin is a Hong Kong 1866 10 cents and it features a strong doubled die obverse. <<|needle|>>There is significant doubling on the lettering and Queen Victoria’s crown.Lastly for this month, we feature a coin from Bulgaria that has a very strong doubled die obverse. <<|needle|>>The coin, a Bulgaria 1960 Lev, shows significant doubling on the lion in the center of the coin. <<|needle|>>The lion in the arms features doubled claws, two tongues, two tails, and doubling on the mane. <<|needle|>>This very cool variety was submitted to PCGS through its Paris office and will now be recognized going forward.Owls are birds of prey, which implies they primarily consume prey animals. <<|needle|>>As a result, their diet is virtually entirely comprised of meat. <<|needle|>>Having said that, owls do eat a wide variety of animals.\n\nThere are about 200 different owl species, each with its own food. <<|needle|>>Some subsist only on bugs, while others spend their days fishing. <<|needle|>>Most owls are opportunistic eaters, which means they will consume anything smaller than themselves that they can catch.\n\nThe vast majority of owls spend the most of their waking hours hunting. <<|needle|>>They frequently have to attempt several times before they catch something.\n\nWhat Is Favorite Food of an Owl?\n\nIt is dependent on the species. <<|needle|>>Owls come in a wide range of sizes and shapes. <<|needle|>>Some species eat only fish. <<|needle|>>Others are tiny and only eat bugs. <<|needle|>>Mice are classic owl delicacies, although not all species catch them. <<|needle|>>However, barn owls primarily consume mice.\n\nShrews and voles are also regularly eaten, therefore they may be considered favored meals in some cases. <<|needle|>>Screech owls, on the other hand, primarily consume insects.\n\nOwls have been observed eating fruit on occasion. <<|needle|>>However, this is uncommon, and owls are still thought to be carnivorous. <<|needle|>>Fruit is eaten by only a few species, hence it isn’t a common occurrence.As a result, you should avoid feeding fruit to owls; they would rather eat meat. <<|needle|>>Fruit is frequently only considered as a food source when prey is scarce. <<|needle|>>Owls may survive for a while on a modest bit of food, but their bodies are built for meat. <<|needle|>>As a result, you rarely witness owls eating fruit in the wild.\n\nHow Much Food Do Owls Consume in a Day?\n\nThe amount of food that an owl consumes each day varies depending on the species. <<|needle|>>Large owls consume a lot of food, whilst little owls consume less. <<|needle|>>An adult barn owl, for example, requires up to three voles every day.\n\nBecause snowy owls are exposed to food less frequently than other owls, they may be able to consume up to 400 grams of lemmings per day. <<|needle|>>When food is accessible, they tend to overeat.\n\nHow Do Owls Hunt?\n\nOwls eat many different animals, ranging from mice to insects to voles to fish and birds. <<|needle|>>Because of their keen hearing, owls are equipped with asymmetrical ears that help them find prey in a pitch-black night.There are more than 200 species of owls. <<|needle|>>One thing they all have in common is they love hunting at night. <<|needle|>>With sharp talons, strong wings and a killer sense of hearing, owls are efficient hunters.\n\nDo Owls Prey on Dogs?\n\nYes. <<|needle|>>Some pets can be eaten by owls, according to the International Owl Center. <<|needle|>>Large owls, on the other hand, are usually the only ones to be concerned about. <<|needle|>>Great horned owls, for example, are frequently large enough to carry off small dogs.\n\nHowever, owls aren’t very good at catching dogs. <<|needle|>>Because they aren’t common prey for owls, they don’t get much practice catching them. <<|needle|>>When their other prey is unavailable, owls will often resort to catching dogs.\n\nEven yet, any pet left outside could end up as an owl’s food. <<|needle|>>As a result, you should never let tiny pets outside unattended. <<|needle|>>If your dog weighs less than 5 pounds, he or she may be in danger. <<|needle|>>Other predators, such as bald eagles and hawks, can also pose major threats.\n\nDo Owls Prey on Squirrels?\n\nOwls will consume almost any tiny animal they can catch, though this depends on the size of the owl. <<|needle|>>Due to their small stature, many owls will be unable to catch squirrels.It is considerably more frequent to consume mice and other similar creatures. <<|needle|>>Many owls primarily consume insects or fish, making squirrels inappropriate for these owls.\n\nBecause rabbits are huge prey species, only large owls can eat them. <<|needle|>>Bunnies are heavier than owls. <<|needle|>>Although great horned owls may easily consume rabbits, many smaller owls are far too small.In any event, bunnies aren’t an owl’s principal food source. <<|needle|>>They are far too large and difficult to capture. <<|needle|>>Mice and other similar animals, on the other hand, are far more common meals.\n\nThe question of whether owls eat cats is a complicated one. <<|needle|>>They most certainly can and do, but it isn’t really something they choose to do. <<|needle|>>A person’s cat may be vulnerable to an owl attack, for example, if it goes outside at night when an owl is hunting.\n\nIt’s not that owls have any particular hunger for cats; rather, it is just another animal (or bird) in their path or territory that they might feast on if given a chance.\n\nLet’s get one thing out of the way: owls don’t eat chickens. <<|needle|>>Sure, they can take them if they want to and it might happen on occasion, but do chickens constitute a large part of their diet?\n\nNo. <<|needle|>>So why do so many people say that owls eat chickens? The answer is simple: because when you Google owls and what do owls eat, that is what pops up.Snakes are one of many kinds of prey for owls. <<|needle|>>Other types of snake include king snakes, indigo snakes, water snakes and coral snakes. <<|needle|>>If an owl spots a nest full of snake hatchlings, it will snatch up as many as it can in its feet and fly away to devour them elsewhere.\n\nThe advantage for an owl is that snake hatchlings are vulnerable creatures at birth with no means to defend themselves.\n\nBats are a common prey of owls. <<|needle|>>All species have been observed preying on bats, but most especially Long-eared, Short-eared and Barn Owls.\n\nIt is thought that they catch bats while they are on their nocturnal flight in open country, or by taking advantage of them when roosting in trees and buildings. <<|needle|>>With wingspans just as wide as an owl’s body, flying foxes and other fruit bats may be caught while still aloft at dusk or dawn.\n\nThe frog is one of those animals that an owl will eat. <<|needle|>>You should be aware of your surroundings if you are in a forest or jungle, and an owl is something to keep an eye out for!They are carnivores, so they will hunt and eat smaller animals like frogs. <<|needle|>>Owls may hunt more than just during nighttime, too; some owls are nocturnal and others might hunt during both day and night.\n\nWell, they will eat any bird or mammal they can hunt and catch. <<|needle|>>So yes, owls have been known to eat dogs but its very rare. <<|needle|>>But generally speaking, if you see an owl out in a field eating something it’s probably eating a rabbit or groundhog.\n\nOn average, an owl can eat 2.5 lizards in one day. <<|needle|>>While an owl prefers some types of lizards over others, it’s not all that picky when it comes to its dinner. <<|needle|>>As long as a lizard has decent size and isn’t too poisonous or toxic, it’ll be on top of an owl’s dinner menu for that night.<image>Owls and other fish-eating birds usually hunt by swooping down on their prey from high in the air. <<|needle|>>Their excellent vision helps them spot a potential meal from great distances. <<|needle|>>Some owls also like to dine on fish.\n\nFish are easier for an owl to catch than most land animals, but they’re still dangerous prey—which is why most fish-eating birds including owls have hooked bills or talons that help them get a good grip on slippery fish scales.\n\nThe owl is a night hunter, and it’s particularly fond of small rabbits. <<|needle|>>Owls can pounce on their prey within mere inches of its resting place. <<|needle|>>Small rabbits are extremely vulnerable at night and an owl swooping down from above presents a deadly surprise.\n\nOwls will eat any reptile they can catch, but they have a particular fondness for lizards and snakes. <<|needle|>>Owls are particularly vulnerable to snake venom; in fact, owls’ keen sense of smell makes them more susceptible to snakebites than other birds.Skunks can be found living in a wide variety of environments, including grasslands, forests, tundra and wetlands. <<|needle|>>Most of these species are nocturnal—which is why so many people are surprised when they wake up to an owl perched on their porch or walk outside to find a dead skunk on their lawn.\n\nBirds, such as chickens and pigeons, are easy prey for an owl. <<|needle|>>Once an owl has spotted one of these winged creatures, it will swoop down and attack by going directly at its target—making a series of quick nosedives until it manages to catch hold of its victim in its talons.\n\nIt then takes flight to a high perch where it can enjoy itself in peace. <<|needle|>>Other birds that owls eat include turkeys, ducks, crows and seagulls.\n\nThese pesky rodents are notorious for destroying gardens, crops and furniture. <<|needle|>>They’re also quite tasty when served up with a side of mashed potatoes—as long as you have an owl handy. <<|needle|>>It’s no secret that owls eat a lot of mammals, including rabbits, mice and even rats. <<|needle|>>Squirrels, however, can be one of their favorite snacks.\n\nIn reality, owls will eat mice in addition to small birds and large insects. <<|needle|>>Often, they nab these creatures by swooping down and grabbing them while they sleep in their nest or burrow. <<|needle|>>Owls have particularly sensitive hearing, which means they can pinpoint sleeping prey with ease.Owls are obligate carnivores for the most part. <<|needle|>>To put it another way, they solely eat the meat of prey animals. <<|needle|>>They spend the majority of their waking hours eating or hunting. <<|needle|>>The creatures that these birds consume will vary depending on their species.\n\nMost owls specialize in one sort of food, however some are more opportunistic than others. <<|needle|>>Certain species fish or predominantly consume insects, while the majority simply eat whatever they can get their beaks on.\n\nSmall dogs, as well as fruit, are sometimes prey for these birds. <<|needle|>>However, this is uncommon and usually occurs when other prey items have become scarce.\n\nSpread the love\nTags: What Do Owls Eat?Tom King, president of the NY State Rifle and Pistol Association, discusses the gun law he is challenging on ‘America’s Newsroom.’\n\nDavid Chipman, President Biden’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has some questionable ideas on gun suppressors and assault weapons.\n\nGun control advocates have praised the nomination of Chipman, who was an ATF special agent for 25 years and currently serves as senior policy adviser to gun violence prevention group Giffords, highlighting the significance of the ATF director’s role in enforcing gun laws.\n\nGun rights advocates, on the other hand, have expressed alarm at Chipman’s stances on gun-related topics, including suppressors and assault weapons.\n\n“Anyone who has worked in law enforcement for as long as I have will tell you that silencers were not designed to protect hearing, they were designed to make it difficult for people to identify the sound of gunfire and locate active shooters,” Chipman said in a 2017 statement.A Washington Post fact check gave the claim a rating of three “Pinocchios.”\n\nConversely, during a 2017 congressional hearing on the Sportsmen’s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act, the ATF nominee asserted that a person would “absolutely” need to wear ear protection while using a suppressor “if they cared about their ears.”\n\nSuppressors have been around for about a century, and people use them on a range of firearms, including hunting rifles and home defense guns, Rice explained.\n\nHe added that suppressors are not like those shown “in the movies”; they do not silence guns. <<|needle|>>Instead, gun owners use suppressors to lower the decibel of the sound a firearm makes when it goes off “to a level that will not damage hearing.”Chipman, however, said in a 2019 interview with the Virginia-Pilot, after 12 people and a gunman were fatally shot during a mass shooting in Virginia Beach, that a suppressor “makes a gun sound sort of like a handgun.”\n\nThe gunman used a legally purchased suppressor attached to a .45-caliber handgun before carrying out the massacre, prompting local and federal politicians to draft gun reform legislation banning suppressors.\n\nLater in 2019, Chipman told NPR that the primary purpose of a suppressor “is for someone who is on the offensive to maintain the element of surprise longer.”\n\nRice refuted this and brought up the Virginia Beach mass shooting as an exception in his explanation of suppressors. <<|needle|>>He said that when Gun Owners of America analyzed active shooters across the country, if found most criminals do not use suppressors.\n\n“Criminals don’t really use suppressors,” he said. <<|needle|>>“Criminals are sneaky people, and they want to hide their guns. <<|needle|>>Suppressors make guns much longer…and more difficult to hide.”\n\nAdditionally, most armed criminals do not want to go through the process of legally obtaining a firearm, which can take up to a year in some cases, Rice said.Gun silencers or suppressors are becoming increasingly popular in the real world as hunters and other gun owners adopt them for hearing protection. <<|needle|>>(Reuters/ Jim Urquhart)\n\n“A person who wishes to buy [a suppressor] needs to go to a Class 3 gun dealer, pick one out, fill out a form with all kinds of personal information, provide [photo ID] and fingerprints, and they have to submit the form with a $200 payment to the ATF, and the ATF will approve or deny sale with no time limit,” Rice said.\n\nHe added that even with suppressors in the equation, most people are able to identify the sound of gunfire.\n\n“It doesn’t make a gun sound like a nail gun,” Rice said.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by the American Accountability Foundation, Chipman authored a beginner’s guide to firearms called “Firearms 101” in collaboration with gun violence prevention group ARS and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence that mislabels several guns as “assault weapons.”\n\nThe guns presented in Chipman’s guide under the label of “assault weapons” are not classified as such under federal law. <<|needle|>>Guns are classified by their functions and components as defined in chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code.\n\nTwo of the guns categorized in Chipman’s presentation are categorized as National Firearms Act (NFA) firearms. <<|needle|>>A fully automatic AK-47, for example, is classified as a “machine gun” under the NFA. <<|needle|>>A semi-automatic AK-47 is classified differently and can fall under the category of a rifle. <<|needle|>>Similarly, an AR-15 can be classified as a pistol, rifle, short barrel rifle and so on depending on its functions and components.Rice noted that Chipman’s labels resemble the 1994 definition of the term based on the decade-long Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which prohibited the manufacturing, distribution and sale of more than a dozen different semi-automatic firearms and features that resembled fully automatic, military firearms.\n\nThe Federal Assault Weapons Ban definition differs from the more traditional definition of an assault weapon, which is a military firearm that can switch between semiautomatic and fully automatic fire.\n\nRice believes “assault weapon” is a “junk term coined by people who disagree with citizens owning any firearms whatsoever,” he said.\n\nHe added that there were school shootings and violent crimes in the 10-year period of the assault weapons ban, and the only people who obeyed the ban were law-abiding gun owners.\n\nChipman has expressed skepticism about the feasibility of confiscating assault weapons from their current owners.\n\nIn an op-ed he penned in The Roanoke Times last year, Chipman described himself as a “proud gun owner” who has sometimes been “mischaracterized as a gun grabber.” Chipman noted that he supports gun safety regulations that would “save lives” but wouldn’t take guns away from law-abiding citizens.\n\n“I am a proud and responsible gun owner, as are millions of Virginians,” Chipman wrote. <<|needle|>>“I am also permitted to carry a concealed handgun. <<|needle|>>I am not afraid of lawmakers in Richmond passing laws to make it harder for criminals to get guns. <<|needle|>>In fact, I’m part of the majority who demand it.”\n\nATF is a law enforcement agency within the Department of Justice that strives to safeguard the public from criminal organizations and activity, including the illegal use and trafficking of firearms.Supplementing With Iodine? Make Sure It’s the Right Kind for You!\n\nIodine is absolutely essential for every function in your body, including immune function, cardiovascular health, and metabolism. <<|needle|>>Of course, it’s most instrumental for the thyroid, since iodine is the foundation for thyroid hormone production.\n\nAccording to the American Thyroid Association [1], close to half of the U.S. <<|needle|>>population suffers from lack of energy, temperature dysregulation, cognitive impairment, metabolic irregularity, and other conditions consistent with insufficient iodine intake.\n\nThe fact is that most of us need more iodine in our bodies. <<|needle|>>But what kind of iodine is right for you?\n\nIodine in Salt: Goiter Prevention and That’s About ItYou may find it hard to believe that Americans and the rest of the world are so deficient in iodine. <<|needle|>>After all, you may think, don’t they put iodine in table salt?\n\nIt’s true that most people in the U.S. <<|needle|>>and the world get most of their iodine through salt. <<|needle|>>This poses more than one challenge, however. <<|needle|>>The first issue with consuming iodine from table salt is that you will not get enough.\n\nThe addition of iodine to the U.S. <<|needle|>>salt supply started in the 1920s in response to a government health mandate. <<|needle|>>During that time, up to 40% of the population of the upper Midwest and Great Lakes region suffered from goiters and other thyroid diseases caused by extreme iodine deficiency [2]. <<|needle|>>[Note: a goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland that results in a swelling of the neck.]\n\nAdding iodine to table salt did help with the goiter epidemic, but that was about it. <<|needle|>>Nonetheless, it became the foundation upon which the U.S. <<|needle|>>RDA, or Recommended Daily Allowance (now called the Recommended Daily Intake, or RDI [3]) was built. <<|needle|>>Today, the RDI for iodine is 150 mcg/day for an adult and 220 mcg/day for a pregnant woman. <<|needle|>>This amount may stop goiters, but it’s not enough for all the iodine needs of the body.\n\nThe second issue with table salt is the amount of toxins that are in it. <<|needle|>>This concern was not present in the 1920s when the mandate began, but has become a reality in the age of cutting corners for safety and health in the name of big profit. <<|needle|>>While salt in the 1920s still came from the sea or mineral deposits, today’s “iodized salt” is actually a man-made form of sodium called sodium chloride (with iodide added to it).\n\nIn order to make salt white and help it last longer, most manufacturers use a bleaching process. <<|needle|>>This adds dangerous halides such as chlorine and bromide to the mix, which block the body’s absorption of iodine. <<|needle|>>In addition, other chemicals are often added to the salt, including manufactured iodide, sodium solo-co-aluminate, fluoride sodium bicarbonate, anti-caking agents, and aluminum derivatives [4].\n\nIf you are going to sprinkle salt on your food, most health experts suggest Himalayan pink salt or Celtic sea salt, which contains trace amounts of naturally produced iodine as well as other essential minerals.\n\nIs There Iodine in Food?\n\nOkay, so if you can’t rely on table salt to provide you with enough iodine… what about the iodine in food? Long before there were supplements, people the world over were eating enough of the right kind of foods to get the iodine they needed, correct?\n\nIf you look at the situation from a historical perspective, this is absolutely true. <<|needle|>>Foods such as seaweed, sea food, fish, eggs, spinach, dairy, strawberries, and cranberries [5] have a high iodine load when compared to other foods. <<|needle|>>In the past, eating these foods with iodine would ensure healthy amounts of iodine in the body.\n\nZoom in on the last 20 years or so, however, and you will see a completely different picture. <<|needle|>>The depletion of nutrients in the soil, as well as an increasing toxic load, has changed the amount of essential nutrients available in the foods we eat.\n\nHere is a case in point: In a multi-decade study, researchers at the University of Texas analyzed the nutritional components of 43 different vegetables and fruits grown in the U.S. <<|needle|>>between 1950 and 1999. <<|needle|>>The report, published in the Journal of the America College of Nutrition [6], discovered “reliable declines” in essential vitamins and minerals in 1999 compared to 1950 samples.”<image>Potassium and sodium are often part of the picture because they act as carriers for iodine that the human body can safely absorb. <<|needle|>>Iodine in its natural state is unstable and even dangerous. <<|needle|>>Scientists discovered a while ago that combining potassium with iodine to form potassium iodide can create a more stable form, which can be absorbed by the body.\n\nMolecular iodine, sometimes found in tablet form, is absorbed into the thyroid at a low rate but into breast tissue at a high rate. <<|needle|>>This makes molecular iodine a go-to for many who wish to help prevent breast-related conditions such as fibrocystic breast disease and breast cancer.\n\nResearchers at Queen’s University Department of Surgery in Ontario, Canada, state in a report for the Canadian Journal of Surgery that “[the] results indicate the superiority of molecular iodine over iodides when treating fibrocystic breast disease [7].”\n\nKI is a very stable form of iodine, so by flooding the system with it right after exposure and over the next 24 hours, the thyroid gland can become “full” and will not take in any more iodine, radioactive or otherwise. <<|needle|>>This mechanism is why the World Health Organization [9] currently has protocols in place for “Iodine Prophylaxis” right after nuclear accidents. <<|needle|>>The main threats of events like Chernobyl and Fukushima is that when reactors leak, they will continue to spill radioactive Iodine-131 as well as cesium-137 into the environment for years after [10].\n\nThe downside regarding potassium iodine for everyday use is that only about 20% of this kind of iodine can be assimilated by the body.\n\nDid you know that iodine is absolutely essential to every function in your body? Watch this video to learn how you can boost sluggish metabolism and energy.\n\nYou may have noticed that some iodine supplements come in liquid form. <<|needle|>>These liquids are usually created by using either alcohol or glycerin.\nThe advantage of using a liquid for iodine transport is that it becomes more bioavailable to the body. <<|needle|>>Iodine in alcohol, however, is not the preferred method of liquid transport for several reasons.\n\nFirst, most alcohol used for supplements are simple ethanol or grain alcohols, the same kind that the bartender puts in your favorite martini. <<|needle|>>Because of this, alcohol-based iodine may not be appropriate for young people, pets, those with high blood sugar, or those recovering from alcoholism.\n\nIn addition, almost all alcohols are made with genetically-modified corn and are not something you want to consume daily if you are striving for a healthy lifestyle [11].On the other hand, glycerin (also known as glycerine, glycerol, or glycerite) has many advantages – that is, if you can find the right kind. <<|needle|>>Most commercial glycerin-based products, like commercial soaps, are sourced through animal products. <<|needle|>>A better option is vegetable-based glycerin. <<|needle|>>And the best of all is organic, non-GMO glycerin that is not made from soy or corn.\n\nOrganically-derived, vegetable-based glycerin has many advantages for both external and internal use. <<|needle|>>Unlike alcohol, which is a drying agent, glycerin retains moisture and does not evaporate in air. <<|needle|>>Glycerin can be a great salve for burns and is an antiseptic as well. <<|needle|>>It won’t upset blood sugar levels and, as a boon, iodine in glycerin has a much longer, more stable shelf life.\n\nNascent iodine is also known as atomic iodine, monatomic iodine, Atomidine, or colloidal iodine. <<|needle|>>The term “nascent” refers to iodine that has an incomplete number of electrons. <<|needle|>>This gives it an electrical charge, according to a report conducted by the non-profit Weston Price Foundation [12] and others.\n\nNascent iodine’s charge is what makes it uniquely special. <<|needle|>>Many forms of dietary iodine break down into iodide in the digestive tract. <<|needle|>>In this state, iodine-dependent organs like the thyroid and reproductive organs cannot use it. <<|needle|>>The charge of nascent iodine helps it stay intact and absorb quickly and thoroughly into the organs that need it most.\n\nHigh-absorption is most helpful for the thyroid because nascent iodine can help this important gland maintain homeostasis. <<|needle|>>A balanced, properly-working thyroid ensures that that the body is operating with overall vitality, health, and strong immune function.\n\nWhich Iodine Supplement Is the Best for You?\n\nIodine is perhaps the most important nutrient for your body to ensure total health. <<|needle|>>For the health of your thyroid, and every organ, make sure you are getting enough highly-absorbable, organic, nascent iodine every day.\n\nYou may have deduced by now which form of iodine is the absolute best for day-to-day consumption. <<|needle|>>That’s right: a nascent iodine in a non-GMO, organic, and vegetable-based glycerin solution carrier [13]. <<|needle|>>You can get all of this in Organixx organic Iodine.\n\nThe Health Dangers of Table

goes as far as Mosta, and a longer route which takes in a trip round much of the coastline. <<|needle|>>The two routes are interchangeable, in that one ticket does both.\nThe exit from Valletta itself is exactly the same as the south tour, but they diverge after the Valletta Waterfront, with this route going via San Anton Gardens to Mdina and Rabat.Mdina is in the middle of the island and is the original capital of Malta, named by Sicilian Arabs and abandoned when Valletta was built, at which time it earned the nickname of ‘Silent City’. <<|needle|>>It’s easy to see why this nickname has remained because the narrow streets are hushed, and there is an air of silence inside the moat and walls. <<|needle|>>It is another absorbing place to visit, and just strolling through the streets, having a coffee, watching the lace makers’ makes for a splendid few hours.Don’t ignore Rabat, adjacent to Mdina (in Arabic the names means suburb) and also displaying some of Malta’s amazing history. <<|needle|>>The Domus Romana, right outside the Mdina moat, is a building from Roman times, restored and now a museum housing statues from that era, and the most fascinating mosaic floor. <<|needle|>>Although I am not particularly interested in Roman history, I am glad I didn’t miss this.\nRabat would seem to have a thing about underground burials, because in a small town (population about 12,500) there are two churches with catacombs – St Paul’s and St Agatha’s. <<|needle|>>St Paul’s is so named because it is close to the grotto where St Paul is supposed to have spent some time. <<|needle|>>I’m afraid I cannot comment on either of the catacombs, because I do not do deep underground places! I did look at the churches, though, and St Paul’s has two small chapels underneath the main church, which, I understand, are interesting – one can see the relics of Roman torture because, prior to being consecrated, this was used as a Roman prison.\nSt Agatha’s also houses a small museum, but I have to say, for me there was little of much interest.\nThe town is much like any other, but interesting for a stroll if only to see how other countries live.\nThe next stop for the bus is at Ta Qali. <<|needle|>>This is the craft village of Malta, and, I’m afraid, appeared similar to every other craft village in any country where there are tourists. <<|needle|>>It was not somewhere I got off the bus.\nNext to Mosta where the rotunda church is the third largest unsupported dome in the world, and quite a sight, but the outside can be viewed easily from the bus.Mgarr, the next place/church on the route has a similar shaped domed church, though smaller. <<|needle|>>It was intended to be a smaller version of Mosta, but ended up more ovoid, explained by the fact that it was funded by selling eggs!\nThe remainder of this bus tour is a journey round the various resorts in Malta. <<|needle|>>It is possible to get off at any of these, but I stayed on the bus and enjoyed the fantastic coastal views and scenery.I can imagine nothing more fitting to celebrate the Queens birthday than afternoon tea and Browns Brasserie in Manchester in giving everyone the chance to do just that until 30th June. <<|needle|>>Browns Brasserie have created a very special afternoon tea in celebration of this momentous occasion and on Fathers Day we headed along to give it a try.<image>The Royal Afternoon tea costs £17.95 per person and is for a minimum of two people. <<|needle|>>It includes a British Royal cocktail which is made with black cow vodka, rosehip and rhubarb cordial and apple, topped with prosecco. <<|needle|>>The cocktail was really good and I can imagine it would be very refreshing on a hot day. <<|needle|>>Unfortunately, fathers day in Manchester was a bit of a washout but the cocktail helped me dream of summer even if the weather disappointed me.The sandwiches were a selection of mini butter brioche rolls with some traditional fillings. <<|needle|>>We had smoked salmon with chive and lemon cream cheese, free range egg and baby watercress and coronation chicken. <<|needle|>>These are the same sandwiches that you get in the standard Browns Brasserie afternoon tea and they were really nice. <<|needle|>>The use fo the butter brioche rolls made them feel very luxurious and were more filling than the standard finger sandwiches.The mini dessert level was jam packed with flavour. <<|needle|>>My favourite was the salted caramel profiterole followed by the extremely chocolatey brownie. <<|needle|>>We also had a Pimms jelly and an earl grey tea cake. <<|needle|>>The pot with the raspberry on top is a white chocolate pot that was served for the girls in place of the Pimms jelly. <<|needle|>>On the standard Browns Brasserie Afternoon Tea, you would get the White chocolate pot as standard and a red velvet cake instead of the brownie.Afternoon tea wouldn’t be complete without the scones, clotted cream, and jam. <<|needle|>>The scones were served warm and were able to be cut without crumbling too much and the clotted cream and jam were the perfect accompaniments.The motorcycle is slower than the car but faster than the bicycle.Victim Aurora Fernandes been exanimated by Dr. <<|needle|>>Orlando Zoghbi and close detail of the suffered wounds\nIn the years of 1977 and 1978, locals of northern Brazil were terrorized by what they described as luminous and vampire balls of light, a phenomenon soon nicknamed “chupa-chupa“, meaning “suck-suck”. <<|needle|>>Bright objects of differing shapes, sizes and colours were said to have been flying at low altitudes - just a few metres above the tops of trees - and firing light beams at people on the ground below. <<|needle|>>Several witnesses claimed to have seen beings piloting the crafts, describing them as no more than three to four feet tall. <<|needle|>>What separates these sightings from the usual glimpses of UFOs in the skies are the numerous and recurring injuries that people suffered.\n\nThe FAB (Força Aérea Brasileira) deemed these reports serious enough to launch Operação Prato, the first ever military mission in that country with an exclusive focus on UFOs. <<|needle|>>Leading the investigation was Captain Uyrangê Bolivar Soares Nogueira de Hollanda Lima. <<|needle|>>For approximately four months, Capt. <<|needle|>>Hollanda and his team interviewed witnesses, took photos, and ultimately restored calm in the area. <<|needle|>>The body of material he collected includes 2,000 pages of text, 500 photographs and 16 hours of (movie) film. <<|needle|>>He passed all this information on to his superiors.\n\nIn 1997, shortly after the files from his mission were declassified, Capt. <<|needle|>>Holland gave an interview to a popular Brazilian UFO magazine. <<|needle|>>He recounted how terrified his subjects were, and discussed some of the most compelling evidence. <<|needle|>>On the volume of the declassified material are some interesting cases with detailed drawings of the objects flying over the skies of Corales around that time.\n\nSanto Antônio do Tauá – Amelia Martins da Silva, was Walking from Santo Antônio do Tauá to her home with one of her daughters Odete; when 2 kilometers from the village she saw coming from the right something like a reddish-yellow light, very bright (like the headlight on a car). <<|needle|>>Initially the light was cutting diagonally across the road but abruptly changed direction coming exactly in the direction of her and her daughter, rapidly crossing to their left. <<|needle|>>They sought shelter under a tree, the object stopped for several minutes, then slowly moved and returned to its original direction (E/SW) and headed toward Vigia/Belém.\n\nAmelia suffered no physical effects and did not fear  the encounter. <<|needle|>>She thought that the object was very beautiful and she was pleased to see such a new thing. <<|needle|>>The altitude was about 30 meters. <<|needle|>>Odete Martins da Silva, 35 Amelia's daughter ,being by temperament very timid, she agreed with the accuracy of the report of her mother. <<|needle|>>Amelia described the object about 1.30 meters wide( she compared it to a table in her home) with one meter high, round like an inverted plate with a sharp protuberance sticking out from which came a reddish luminescence,  the body a color blue from which came bright light giving the impression of being transparent. <<|needle|>>She did not see any human forms inside the object. <<|needle|>>Its movement was slow, but at times it accelerated with the speed of a jet plane.Santo Antônio do Ubintuba - Rio Bituba, side road at Km 32, PA-16 Rd. <<|needle|>>– Raimundo Nonato Barbosa (“Birro”), 48 – He said he was returning to his house… and when he was near a friend’s house he felt like he was losing his strength… he lost one of his shoes… but continued walking… looked back over his shoulder and saw a circular reddish-yellow shape with multi-colored tail 30 to 40 meters away … about 1.50 meters in size moving five to ten meters above the ground and emitting a ray of bright blue light that hit witness in the back. <<|needle|>>No noise. <<|needle|>>Very frightened, he gathered his strength to run to the home of his friend, screaming for help. <<|needle|>>In a hurry to see behind him…the object had stopped just over the trees, leaving behind a trail of sparkling flashes of different colors. <<|needle|>>He complained his body was shaking, he had a headache and felt numbness and partial paralysis and other physical effects.Colares – Wellaide Cecim Carvalho, 24, doctor and head of the Colares Hospital – Dr. <<|needle|>>Wellaide affirmed having observed on the days and hours respectively cited a bright metallic object spinning over the front part of the village (beach of Cajueiro NE at low altitude, 100 meters) at an estimated distance of 1,500 meters without producing any sound. <<|needle|>>She described the objects  like Conical-cylindrical in shape (upper part more narrow) having an apparent size at her distance of 3 meters in width and 2 in diameter. <<|needle|>>The object  moved in an irregular manner (vertical position on its longitudinal axis), accentuated wavy or rocking motion, all the time making swift stops and turning at the same time. <<|needle|>>She says she observed closely, being on one occasion accompanied by other people in front of the local state hospital.Another craft on the report is described as saucer type round of 1 meter in diameter, with an array of yellow light on the lower portion of a dark metallic material with a light gray metallic ring around it. <<|needle|>>The object had a bright dome with panels on top portion emitting a white intense light. <<|needle|>>On the lower part the craft have a porthole were an bright red light was shouting

<<|needle|>>The object did not make any sound<image>Colares – Antônio Ferreira, 35 Painter, resident of Colares – He saw what he described as an airship oval-cylindrical in shape. <<|needle|>>reddish on the bottom and bright metallic gray at the top section. <<|needle|>>moving faster than a jet in the direction of SE/NE around 1,200 meter of altitude. <<|needle|>>He estimated that the overall diameter of the object was approximately half a meter with a length of one meter. <<|needle|>>The object was moving in a very irregular matter described like a fast wavy pulsing action and spinning occasionally.April 1977(more than six months before Operacao Prato began) Four wood cutters were aboard an old wooden fishing boat and they had gone to the uninhabited Crab Island in the Bay of Sao Marcos, to get wooden pales to sell. <<|needle|>>The island is hundreds of kilometers east of Colares. <<|needle|>>The next day three of the men awoke the next morning to find the fourth dead in his hammock. <<|needle|>>Two of the survivors were burned, one seriously. <<|needle|>>The survivors have never learned what happened to them. <<|needle|>>A number of people in the Sao Marcos-Crab Island-Pinheiro area were burned by UFOs in incidents similar to those in Colares and Vigia. <<|needle|>>The sightings lasted for four months (April, May, June and July 1977) before tapering off, and apparently the UFOs then moved on to the Colares area. <<|needle|>>Hollanda believed that after leaving the Colares area they went farther west into Amazonas.\n\nSome of the locals interviewed by Hollanda described a recurring craft with unusual cylindrical shape with an opening at the top. <<|needle|>>A row a blinking bright lights at the located bottom section, with two protruding appendices that seem to be some kind of antennae. <<|needle|>>The object was emitting a intense ray of light that was reflected by the water, This craft moved in a horizontal manner.Pará, a northern Brazilian state, is the site of Amazonia National Park. <<|needle|>>Protecting a vast swath of the dense, lush Amazon Rainforest, the park is home to thousands of wildlife species. <<|needle|>>Much of it floods annually, making remote areas accessible by boat. <<|needle|>>Near the mouth of the Amazon River is Belém,\nThe village of Colares is located on the island of the same name in the north part of Pará, facing the Marajo Bay that goes off the Atlantic Ocean. <<|needle|>>The population was comprised of humble working people like fisherman, farmers etc.\n\nThe Chupa-chupa incident began with lights all over Colares. <<|needle|>>sometimes in shape of a hat, round, disc, like an umbrella. <<|needle|>>The locals saw things all over, Bacuri, Penta do Machadinho, Praia do Correo . <<|needle|>>They seemed to come from way up high, from many places, from the sky, from the bay, from a horizontal position. <<|needle|>>Around 6' o'clock when the sun set, groups of as many as 50 to 60 people would get together in one house, women and children. <<|needle|>>At night, people saw many lighted objects flying and in formation at times.In the Prato investigation between October 1977 and January 1978, intelligence agents from the Air Force base in Belém in northern Brazil interviewed hundreds of witnesses in Colares and about thirty other villages north of Belém .As stated earlier, Intelligence agents spent four months investigating hundreds of sightings and encounters. <<|needle|>>It was a small team consisting only of Captain Uyrangê Hollanda and six sergeants, who were armed only with a theodolite, cameras and tape recorders\n\nAfter four months, Brigadier Protázio Lopes de Oliveira, the base commander in Belém, shut down the investigation. <<|needle|>>Hollanda and his second in command, Sergeant Flávio Costa, then compiled a final report consisting of about 500 pages of documents plus several hundred photos and motion picture films of UFOs, and numerous maps and sketches. <<|needle|>>Many of the sketches show the paths of several UFOs passing over an area on the same night. <<|needle|>>All of this was sent to Air Force Headquarters in Brasília and none of the records were made public until May 20, 2005, and then only to the handful of ufologists who had been invited to meet with the military leaders. <<|needle|>>During the Brasília meetings, the ufologists were allowed to examine about 110 photos and 160 documents from Operation Prato. <<|needle|>>However, over the years, photocopies of many of the Operação Prato documents and at least eighteen photographs were leaked to civilian and this are some of them:<image>As Bob Pratt said, Operacao Prato is unique in the history of the UFO phenomenon. <<|needle|>>It resulted in well-documented proof that UFOs are real. <<|needle|>>Never before or since has such a long series of sightings and encounters been officially investigated by the government of any country, especially one the size of Brazil. <<|needle|>>Now if you can get FAB to open those files to the public.\n\nOver a long period of time these objects flew wherever they wanted to with impunity. <<|needle|>>They appeared in the form of brilliant lights, often in the shape of balls and discs, moving swiftly or slowly or hovering and often executing sharp maneuvers. <<|needle|>>Sometimes they shot out beams of light that targeted people, burning them. <<|needle|>>At times, objects/crafts were seen diving into the waters of Marajo Bay and coming out, and sometimes fishermen saw blue lights moving around under the water.So, this time I thought I’d take a look at the revisionist history novel, The Revenant and its subsequent adaptation, which earned Leonardo DiCaprio the Oscar that’s eluded him for decades. <<|needle|>>At last!!\n\nWhat did you think of this one – were you a lover or a hater? Add your comments at the end of the post. <<|needle|>>Enjoy …\n\nI’ve been obsessed with The Frontier and The Wild West since I saw Dances With Wolves when I was still a little girl, so Hugh Glass has been a source of fascination for me for years. <<|needle|>>I was absolutely agog that a man could survive such an horrific bear attack AND basically crawl across across America in search of his beloved rifle. <<|needle|>>It really puts a fresh spin on both the revenge myth and the whole ‘American Dream’ thing, especially the notion ‘you want something badly enough, you will DO IT, by hook or by crook’.I’m a big fan of The Man Who Returned From The Dead by John Myers Myers, which is probably the definitive biography on Glass. <<|needle|>>Whilst Punke doesn’t *quite* get across the same sense of indignation regarding the Andstadt that Myers does in his biography, there is enough here to keep me happy: there are some brilliant set pieces (not least the last in the water, with Glass sailing head-first into a confrontation with the Arikara). <<|needle|>>There’s fab visuals galore and Glass’ lucky escapes are well drawn.\n\nI was also impressed with the representations of the Native Americans, whose actions are both understandable and relatable, especially when the children kill Pig, the gigantic and foul-smelling Frontiersman (who must have been terrifying to their young eyes). <<|needle|>>Punke draws on Glass’ well-documented history with Native Americans well too, so we can understand how he is able to relate to, and respect, the old woman at Fort Brazeau and build her a funeral pyre. <<|needle|>>This in turn means the Sioux warriors help him.\n\nLike many reviewers and book bloggers, I do feel the ending goes out with a whimper and there are a few biographical notes that stick out, especially towards the beginning. <<|needle|>>I would also have liked a little more from Henry and Ashley, especially given the historical note at the end was so interesting. <<|needle|>>Otherwise, I loved this book and recommend it most highly to those who love historical novels and The Wild West.‘Based on a true story’ is major currency in Hollywood, as are novel adaptations, so it’s not difficult to see why The Revenant got adapted.\n\nOr did it? The novel says it’s ‘the book that inspired the movie’, plus the film says it’s ‘based in part’ on Michael Punke’s novel! Whilst there are some obvious signposts to the book and the original story behind it, this has to be one of the LOOSEST possible adaptations I’ve seen in a good while.\n\nFirst, the good stuff. <<|needle|>>It obviously LOOKS amazing. <<|needle|>>The Arikara attack at the beginning, starting with an arrow through a Frontiersman’s throat out of the blue, is frightening and refreshingly realistic. <<|needle|>>There’s a real sense of bedlam and menace as Braves storm the camp. <<|needle|>>The yells and hoots of their brothers in arms encircling the camp, forcing the frontiersman into the water is fantastic and not ‘movie-like’ at all – you get a real sense of how terrifying it must have been.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is on fine form, but then he has to be one of the most consistent actors of his generation. <<|needle|>>Tom Hardy is clearly in his element (as he always is playing antagonists), but for me the two stand-out performances have to be Will Poulter as Bridger and Domhnall Gleeson as Captain James Henry. <<|needle|>>Both characters are so clearly desperate and out of their depth; the actors’ performances portray this brilliantly.The pace of the movie is great, but I was disappointed to see just how far the film strays from the original novel. <<|needle|>>There were so many great moments in the novel that were left out, with their replacements very ‘Hollywoodised’. <<|needle|>>Glass’ Pawnee son Hawk was an obvious choice – what movie-watcher could relate to the idea of a frontiersman being THAT attached to a rifle? – but his unfortunate demise was cheesy. <<|needle|>>I also didn’t understand why Fitzgerald didn’t kill Glass straight after, especially when it appears Bridger didn’t come back straight away. <<|needle|>>Perhaps it was a bad edit. <<|needle|>>What’s more, Captain Henry DIES! (He didn’t in history, nor did he help Glass recapture Fitzgerald!).\n\nHowever, I could have coped with all that if we hadn’t been subjected to the excruciating Powaqa story thread. <<|needle|>>I could understand the filmmakers needed to make the Native Americans ‘relatable’, but Glass’ saving Powaqa from the rapist in the soldier camp made little plotting sense other than to paint him as a hero. <<|needle|>>Ack. <<|needle|>>The sad thing was, there were LOADS of human moments in The Revenant novel that could have painted Native Americans in a human light (as in, ‘not the usual bad guys’ in Westerns), not least the the woman at Fort Brazeau and the Sioux who treat Glass’ wounds. <<|needle|>>Oh well!\n\nFor me, the film is not a patch on the book (which in turn is not a patch on The Man Who Returned From The Dead). <<|needle|>>That said, if you are looking for truth, you’re probably not going to be watching a Hollywood movie! If you take it as it is – an exciting, lone wolf story that really puts DiCaprio through his paces – then you won’t be disapointed … Just maybe read the book SECOND.harry shunk met jános kender in paris, where they would become life and work partners. <<|needle|>>from the 1950s to the early 1980s, the duo photographed the spectacular effervescence of the artistic avant-garde across paris and new york city, where they mixed with artists such as john baldessari, christo and jeanne-claude, yayoi kusama and many others. <<|needle|>>among the first to venture outside the photo studio to capture the otherwise private side of the creative scene, shunk-kender created an invaluable record of the art world and its most famous figures. <<|needle|>>the relationships they forged with the artists allowed them to capture private moments and uninhibited experimentation, particularly documented in their close friendship with french artist yves klein. <<|needle|>>a leading member of the french artistic movement ‘nouveau réalism’, or ‘new ways of perceiving the real’, klein’s life, work and world view can be intimately understood through shunk-kender’s lens.\n\nfrom march to september 2020, MASI lugano has staged a monumental exhibition (see 3D tour here) dedicated to shunk-kender’s remarkable photographic archive, among their best-known devoted to klein, including ‘le saut dans le vide’ and ‘anthropométries’. <<|needle|>>designboom visited the exhibition last year and spoke with director of MASI lugano dr. <<|needle|>>tobia bezzola who, since taking on the role, has made photography a primary part of the yearly show plan.all images of the catalogue shunk-kender: art through the eye of the camera by designboom\n\nshunk-kender met klein at iris clert gallery in paris during the preparation of the exhibition ‘le vide’ in 1958, and soon became klein’s favorite photographers. <<|needle|>>from the invitation card to the blue cocktail served to the public, klein envisioned ‘le vide’ and its opening as a holistic event — a total artwork imposing itself on public space. <<|needle|>>this space was understood as a new territory for art, which often jostled and disturbed, such as on january 26, 1962 in the paris museum of modern art. <<|needle|>>in a performative and elaborate work, klein removed the pictures in a room in order to create a ‘zone de sensibilité picturale immatérielle’ (zone of immaterial sensitivity), which involved the sale of documentation of ownership of empty space. <<|needle|>>the same room later housed works by the ‘new realists’ for the comparaisons art fair. <<|needle|>>klein had harry shunk do a reportage in order to document the empty room, and the room filled with works by the ‘new realists’ for the catalogue.the pair also shot anthropométries — on june 5, 1958, klein experimented for the first time in public with the creation of a painting using a ‘living brush’ at the home of his friend robert godet, a publisher and contemporary art collector. <<|needle|>>a few months later, he created his first anthropometric performance in his apartment, a performance he then repeated on march 9, 1959 at the galerie internationale d’art contemporain in paris. <<|needle|>>accompanied by the symphonie monoton-silence, three nude models covered themselves with paint and made prints of their body following the artist’s instructions.furthermore is the documentation of the famous photo, ‘le saut dans le vide’ from october 19, 1960. <<|needle|>>klein jumped off a pillar at the entrance of a house, his face turned toward the sky, his arms outstretched on an apparently deserted street, where a cyclist passes in the distance indifferent to the man who has taken flight. <<|needle|>>the shot was taken after several trial runs, with klein landing on a soft tatami mat held by his partners at his judo club. <<|needle|>>harry shunk then photographed the empty street, and added the cyclist seen from the back. <<|needle|>>‘a man in space!’ was the headline in the dimanche newspaper on november 27, 1906 created by klein for a single issue. <<|needle|>>it reproduced this photomontage, which is undoubtedly the best known of the shunk-kender photographs.yves klein creating an anthropométrie in his studio, paris, 1960\n\n‘yves klein, with his holistic approach combining performance, happenings, literature with painting and sculpture, formulated a method that serves as an example and model for young artists worldwide today,’ said dr. <<|needle|>>tobia bezzola, director of MASI lugano, to designboom about the artist. <<|needle|>>‘meanwhile, shunk-kender are so important because their work shows how photography, starting in the early 1960s, not only accompanied and mapped the world of art. <<|needle|>>rather, in happenings, performative, environmental and conceptual works of those years, photographers became equal collaborators and co-producers of the artists.’<image>anthropométries — the creation of a painting using a ‘living brush’\n\n\nthe exhibition shunk-kender: art through the eye of the camera (1957-1983) at MASI lugano amplifies a strong presence of photography in the repertoire of the museum. <<|needle|>>‘already the museo cantonale d’arte in lugano has taken a great interest in photography from 1987 to 2015, has presented a great number of important exhibitions and has built up a considerable collection,’ dr. <<|needle|>>tobia bezzola continues. <<|needle|>>‘MASI continues this work and will continue to collect and exhibit outstanding photographic positions in the future.’\n\n\nall exhibitions of MASI lugano are currently displayed in their digital museum, where they can be discovered in depth via virtual tour.yves

be virtually impossible to arrive at the same speed in technique of round trip.\n\nThis technique is inspired by the technique of violin bow used especially by Paganini.\n\nThe sweeping has been popularized by people like Jason Baker, Marty Friedman, Yngwie Malmsteem or Frank Gambale.\n\nWhen I was a teenager we started listening to bands like cacophony, Malmsteem, Impilliterri and all that neoclassical wave\n\nI remember going to a concert of Patrick Rondat at the Fnac and we asked him to transcribe the score of Barbarians and the Gates and Patrick, very kindly, we wrote it with his hand on a corner of table and we We shared it as if it were the Holy Grail. <<|needle|>>It is with this piece that I really started to do sweeping. <<|needle|>>(video tutorial)"}
